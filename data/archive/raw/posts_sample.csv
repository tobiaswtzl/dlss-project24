*****
&gt; BEIJING China is still committed to the Paris climate change accord agreed in 2015, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order to dismantle Obama-era climate change regulations.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s main target is former president Barack Obama&amp;#039;s Clean Power Plan, which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a key factor in the United States&amp;#039; ability to meet its commitments under the climate change accord reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris.

&gt; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said climate change was a common challenge for everyone and the Paris agreement was a landmark that came about with the hard work of the international community, including China and the United States.

&gt; China is keen to be seen leading the way in reducing climate change which Trump has in the past dismissed as a &amp;quot;Hoax&amp;quot;.

&gt; &amp;quot;No matter how other countries&amp;#039; policies on climate change change, as a responsible large developing country, China&amp;#039;s resolve, aims and policy moves in dealing with climate change will not change,&amp;quot; he added.

&gt; &amp;quot;We are willing to work with the international community to strengthen dialogue and cooperation, to join hands to promote the process of tackling climate change to jointly promote green, low carbon sustainable development for the whole world, to create an even better future for the next generation.""

That being said I'm starting to wonder if maybe pro-capitalists are sometimes right. They have this big goals of cutting co2 footprint by dozens of %, going full remewable energy, or maybe recycling this or that. Maybe its done for profits but seems like people caring about ecology do push conpanies to be greener.

What is the socialist answer to such claims? I have this thought that's also a very common argument --that capitalism figures things out and in the end people's lives get better. In this case this means having ""green"" offices, being better in this or that way.

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Stricter air pollution rules and higher carbon prices are set to push even more plants into unprofitability, according to the analysts Carbon Tracker, with 97% of the plants losing money by 2030.

&gt; Rapidly falling renewables costs are on track to make building new wind and solar farms cheaper than continuing to run existing coal plants by the mid 2020s.

&gt; In Spain, the government has banned Iberdrola from closing its last coal plants, claiming it is concerned over energy security despite the country&amp;#039;s overcapacity in electricity.

&gt; Coal in Europe is in a &amp;quot;Death spiral&amp;quot;, according to Carbon Tracker, with seven nations including the UK already having announced the end of coal power by 2030 or earlier.

&gt; Carbon Tracker analysed the revenues and operating costs of all the EU&amp;#039;s coal plants and found 54% are already loss making today.

&gt; Brian Ricketts, secretary-general at the industry group Euracoal, said coal was needed to keep the lights on in Europe because renewable energy is unreliable and said &amp;quot;Price gouging&amp;quot; could be expected from gas operators without competition from coal.

&gt; Global warming robbed the oceans of oxygen, they say, putting many species under so much stress that they died off.

&gt; Rocks from the mass extinction appear to have formed when at least some of the ocean was lacking oxygen.

&gt; Animals with a fast metabolism need a lot of oxygen, for example, and so they can&amp;#039;t live in parts of the ocean where oxygen falls below a certain threshold.

&gt; The ocean warmed, too - and according to the model, it began losing oxygen.

&gt; Now, just as during the Permian-Triassic extinction, the ocean is losing oxygen.

&gt; If we proceed to use up all the fossil fuels on Earth, it could warm by as much as 17 degrees Fahrenheit by 2300.As the ocean warms, its oxygen levels will continue to drop.

In my country (NL), I've seen some support for nuclear energy from politicians. But these politicians are usually right wing people who use nuclear mostly to argue against solar and wind. Also they express doubt or outright deny man-made climate change.

As someone who supports nuclear precisely because it has a very low carbon footprint, this bothers me. Also i personally am not opposed to renewables, yet i think they alone won't be enough to supply the world with clean energy.

How should we as a pro-nuclear community deal with these kinds of people?

On one hand they bring nuclear energy back on the political table and provide support in media. Especially because in my country there aren't a lot of people willing to do that, so maybe take what we can get?

On the other hand they are doing it not for environmental reason but to frustrate the debat on climate policy. (Something anti-nuclear people accuse the entire pro-nuclear community of, and i personally dont want)

Also, i mentioned the loudest voices were kinda far right wing, so that doesn't help to get broad societal support from centrists and leftist. There is a 'guilty by association' argument made, that if the far right/climate change deniers like the idea, it's probably a bad idea.

The three challenges are stubbornness, conditioned lifestyle, and advancements in industry. 

Stubbornness or a hesitant to change, is a typically normal expectation when being presented with something new. Change is scary because it is new, often unknown and is out of our comfort zone.  Being open is a pivot point in achieving a better understanding in any field of study. 

Second our conditioned lifestyles can foster a familiar sense of ownership over our lives. We all want choices in how we live and how we achieve our own happiness. Yet these choices could drive the market on how businesses manufacture goods or provide services.

Third advancements in industry only come after someone dares to questions the current process. This question begin with the desire in an individual which ignites a passionate to seek out solutions. Are you the next pioneer of tomorrow? 

Please check out the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (cop26).  Maybe you will be a few of the many pioneer to advance this social endeavor. Maybe a new supporter of this great cause.

Being a young person going through college and reading on certain blogs like Arctic News and Nature Bats Last along with going through this Subreddit has made me think about the extraordinary changes that are taking place at the moment with the distortion of the jetstream causing massive severe weather events that are decimating our ability to produce food, the Arctic Ice threatening to melt away, even this year as the extent and area are at their lowest (http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/arctic.sea.ice.interactive.html, http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/seaice_extent.htm) and with the upcoming El nino (http://www.alternet.org/environment/el-nino-predicted-2015), it seems as though Society is running on fumes at this stage and perhaps come July or August, when the Arctic will probably melt away leaving open sea for the sun's rays to be absorbed, things will more than likely go sideways with society just crashing down to absolutely nothing causing death and destruction. 

Although it is good to perhaps see the adventure in the collapse of society and try to be self sufficient with permaculture, it is hard to try to contemplate the complete collapse of society as we know it, the thought of communities suddenly turning on each other, everyone resorting to cannibalism and the world turning into something that is similar to that of the road. I sound like I am exaggerating, but with the present state of Climate Change and the threat of abrupt methane releases perhaps turning earth into a Permian Extinction Hothouse, the world just seems bleak and it seems as though the recent changes in the climate are a death sentence for every living thing on the planet.

Fighting climate change REQUIRES a strong America. Full stop.

Most global pollution isn't coming from us, and our ability to convince people to pollute less is tied directly to our ability to influence them.

Our ability to influence other nations is tied directly to having a strong economy and a strong military.

Any plan that cuts our emissions but also hampers our growth might help slightly short term but will fail entirely long term, probably dooming the planet to boot.

Making the mightiest America possible is the safest path to even the most radical climate change alarmist's goals.

*One question is how many of the House refusniks, like AOC, have specifically sworn off DCCC funding?* [*As Tom Ferguson explained long-form in 2011*](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/10/tom-ferguson-congress-is-a-coin-operated-stalemate-machine.html)*, House Democrats run what amounts to an explicitly crooked operation where representatives who are supposedly voted in to represent their district instead are told to spend hours a day, every day, fundraising on behalf of the party and then kicking nearly all the dough into the DCCC, which in turn gives representatives “support” in terms of access to publications and research, talking points, and most important, funding when they are up for re-election. Alan Grayson, who as a freshman representative had amassed the most progressive voting record in the House, was denied re-election funding by the DCCC.*

&gt; A woman has brought the charred remains of her bushfire-ravaged home to Parliament House in Canberra, accusing both major political parties of failing to act on climate change.

&gt; The grandmother brought fire-blackened items salvaged from her burnt her home to Canberra to show Prime Minister Scott Morrison what she said was the direct result of climate change.

&gt; &amp;quot;I lost my house, I lost my way of life - my whole community has - and while that was happening, the PM said that he didn&amp;#039;t want us to talk about climate change, that this wasn&amp;#039;t the time,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; &amp;quot;We weren&amp;#039;t allowed to mention climate change and then said that he was praying for us.""

&gt; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t want prayers, I don&amp;#039;t want glib comments about the cricket. I want something to be done and I want it to be done now.""

Lately, as I've seen news about methane gas being released and ocean acidification and all other sorts of climate change related news, it seems that I've found myself actively searching for these things when I browse reddit. What I mean is that I don't go through reddit looking for the funny pictures or anything of that sorts, I'm looking for climate change related articles that I know will freak me out. But I can't help it, I need to know how bad we are screwing things up but at the same time I wish I never went down this path that's making me so damn worried that at any minute we could be facing a mass extinction event that could end humanity... 

I haven't talked to anyone about this fear of mine because I feel like people here where I live would just look at me and tell me that I'm some nut case who shouldn't be worried about things beyond their control. And I understand that there's literally nothing I could do to stop this huge massive crap we are in with our environment, but I can't stop worrying myself sick about it. From reading the news constantly to looking at reddit about these things, I feel as though I'm slowly going insane... 

I don't know, maybe this is just me ranting to a bunch of strangers on the Internet in hopes that my mind will be at ease, but I'm sick of constantly worrying about these things that are beyond my control. I just don't want to be caught off guard not knowing when the inevitable might happen... dying from climate change has been plaguing my thoughts for weeks now... I just want it to stop. I just don't know how to make it stop without knowing that we might somehow be okay living in this world we are in... 

Sorry for the ranting. I just need someone to talk to about this fear that's developed recently that's causing me so much stress and anxiety. :/",[Help] Climate change thoughts running my life.,5

The Royal Australian College of Physicians (RACP) has developed a position on the health effects of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) that can be characterised as catastrophist. Had they been more rigorous in their evaluation their conclusions may have been worth considering.

The RACP has not considered evidence that burning fossil fuels, leading to increased CO2 in the atmosphere, may have minimal impact, or even be beneficial to overall human well being. They have failed as a scientific organisation to consider this question for reasons that remain unclear, but can be speculated on.

Science is not characterised by deference to an accepted consensus. It is based on the precept that there are hypotheses that can be disproved. This theory was described by Karl Popper, and still provides the best explanation of how science works. A theory may stand for decades until a simple experiment shows that it is false. Any dogma should be open to question, and should be questioned vigorously. An intellectual community where scientific notions cannot be questioned has failed as a place of inquiry.

The RACP is a prestigious scientific organisation. To become a member one must complete a medical degree, enduring between 6 and 8 years undergraduate study. Following that, there is period of 6 years on the job training with further specialist examination. Many fellows then do further research degrees such as PhDs. Fellows of the RACP may be known to you as Cardiologists, Haematologists, or Public Health Physicians. There will be a diploma on the wall of their office alongside their medical degree.

As a group they should be well qualified to evaluate the scientific literature surrounding AGW. They understand a complex biological system (the human body). They are familiar with fluid dynamics, the laws of thermodynamics and other processes that are present in climate science. They confront statistical obfuscation within publications on a daily basis, and have expertise in identifying these tricks. Hundreds of medical journals print studies on treatment improvements - many are rubbish. There are systems to deal with conflicting information to provide treatment recommendations. Much dogma within Medicine is overturned by studies that refute prior theories.

Scientific scepticism has been absent in the current RACP Climate Change and Health Position Statement. It states: “Anthropogenic climate change is a global public health emergency,” and “Climate scientists concur that anthropogenic global warming is occurring, is accelerating, and will not stabilise or improve without significant mitigation.”

The position statement of the RACP can be read in full: (https://www.racp.edu.au/news-and-events/all-news/news-details?id=029357af-bbb2-61c2-b08b-ff00001c3177). There is a counter argument that can be made on a line by line basis for every suggestion put forward.  These have been made in well researched monographs, and can be studied at leisure by those with an interest: (http://climatechangereconsidered.org/)

There are arguments which defend the possibility that burning fossil fuels may have minimal impact on human health. For example, the College should have considered the failure of climate models, the economic benefits of burning fossil fuels, the CO2 fertiliser effect, and, the nuclear option in its position paper – it did not. The raw data surrounding all of these questions are easily accessed, and are understandable to anyone with a high school level of science education. 

Some parts of climate data are uncontested. There is little doubt that CO2 levels are rising, and continue to rise, and largely as a result of burning fossil fuels. It is relatively easy to measure atmospheric CO2, and it has been done so accurately. From 1960 the level has increased from 310 ppm to 400 ppm currently. 

Other parts of the AGW hypothesis should be highly contestable because there is greater uncertainty. It is not clear exactly how much of the greenhouse effect is due to CO2, most agree that it is less than 5%. Most of the greenhouse effect is is due to water vapour, and clouds are difficult to measure. Everyone agrees that CO2 is causing some warming, there is dispute about how much, and whether there is diminishing greenhouse effect at higher concentrations. The increase in global temperatures due a to a doubling of CO2 is a prediction not easily tested, subject to the estimates of complex computer models with inherent error margins, and should be hotly contested. 

If the uncertainty inherent in complex models making predictions does not generate enough doubt, there has been an observed failure of global temperatures to rise since 1998. The satellite and land temperature measurements which record this are not seriously contested. The predictions of climate models have been published in the IPCC reports, they state that temperatures should be higher than they are. If one graph is superimposed upon another the divergence is astounding – “97% of computer models agree that the temperature measurements must be wrong.”  

If it is clear that the climate models are inaccurate in short term predictions, and likely lack the competence to predict not only the magnitude but also the direction of temperature change, can the College make any competent recommendations on health policy relating to climate, especially if there is the scope for these decisions to cause harm?

About 70% of global energy comes from fossil fuels. Most of the rest is is either hydroelectric or nuclear, with maybe 3% coming from solar and wind. There are published data to show that rich countries use more energy (if this observation was not self evident). With this wealth comes a whole slew of positive effects on human health and well-being, such as increased longevity and decreased maternal and child mortality. For example: the British use five times the amount of energy per capita than do Indians, they also live 12 years longer.

There are plausible mechanisms to suggest that using energy may promote human well being: using a tractor for harvesting (burning energy) may be better for overall human well-being than toiling in the fields (not using energy). Burning fossil fuels may produce far greater benefits for humanity than harm. To restrict its use may cause delayed development in the third world and unnecessary death.

The question must be asked; how much death will be caused in developing nations by not using the cheapest form of energy? The poorest countries cannot even afford coal. If they are forced to use solar and wind energy at a much greater cost there will be delayed economic development and consequent premature death. That estimate, which points to the potential harm of interference, was curiously absent from the RACP report. Hippocrates and his caution about doing harm has been forgotten by those who should not have forgotten.

CO2 is a colourless, odourless, non carcinogenic micronutrient essential for plant growth. There is good laboratory evidence increased levels of CO2 will increase food production by about 15%. There is good satellite data that the increased levels correlate with increased plant growth in marginal areas. There will be some increased productivity of food growth as a direct result of increased CO2 levels. If a proper account is made for this effect, it is probable that the uncertain harm related to warming may be dwarfed by lower food prices and decreased malnutrition.

Nuclear energy is safer than coal. There are fewer deaths per kilowatt of energy produced. The technology exists, is proven, and can work well. 70% of France's electricity is nuclear, produced with only minor incidents for the past 50 years. It can be produced at roughly twice the cost of fossil fuels. Predictably, this politically unpopular solution is ignored by the College. Instead there is talk of solar and wind alternatives with no account of the costs, currently at least 10 times the cost of fossil fuels.

These are areas of easy to recognise, legitimate dispute. A proper analysis of the health effects of climate change should have considered all of them. How could the RACP not consider them?

The College chose a committee of 10 people to look into the health effects of climate change, none of whom were identifiably sceptical. It has been unapologetic about this decision. The allegation that this is a perversion of the scientific process has been raised with the board of the RACP and no response has been given. 

It is possible that promoting policy in this way is normal practice in academic circles in 2016. It offers some insight as to how the climate catastrophist position might have come to a point of almost undisputed legitimacy among intellectual groups.

Almost no member of the College actually cares what it's doing. In the most recent Presidential election, of 22,669 eligible voters, there were 1,901 votes cast, a parsimonious 8.4% of the electorate.  It is reasonable to extrapolate that even less would care what the College was thinking about climate change. The RACP electorate is disinterested. There is no evidence that more than 1 person in the whole college has had the energy to challenge their position on global warming.

Policy produced by the College coopts many left wing concerns. There are a raft of other issues that are ideologically aligned with AGW that the College produces policy on. These include; improving health outcomes of Indigenous Australians, removing refugees from internment, and restricting access to alcohol. 

There is no necessity that questions surrounding AGW should be above scrutiny because it is part of an ideological basket, or that all persons involved in the College must share this overall ideology. Rather it should be a set of scientific statements that is open to refutation.

It is fair to note that the Lancet, a fairly prestigious medical journal has produced a monograph which corresponds closely to the Colleges stated point of view. Organisations such as the British Medical Association and the American Medical Association have been promoting the same conclusions.

The College has presented a public statement which adds gravitas to support those arguing for action in relation to AGW. The College, an organisation which should have the competence to know whether AGW is a health problem, has stated clearly that it is a problem. It adds its name to a long list of other organisations gripped by the same preconceptions. To the uninformed reader it adds weight to the evidence that there is a problem that must be dealt with. 

In reality there has been no effort to explore the question. This attitude may be symptomatic of a more general malaise in modern academic organisations which likewise failed to explore the same question with proper diligence.

It is possible that the RACP is correct; AGW is a 'public health emergency'. It is possible that energy is not so important in human development that it can be provided at a significant premium; it is possible that increased food production and cheaper food prices do not occur as a result of increased CO2 fertilisation; it is possible that the average of all climate models will suddenly accurately predict global temperatures; and it is possible that solar is financially competitive to fossil fuels. The college should have considered all of theses reasonable questions and provided evidence to support their position, but they did not.

Physicians should understand that theories can be challenged, and there is institutional resistance to unpopular or new ideas; in the recent memory of Australian physicians is the discovery that a microorganism was responsible for duodenal ulcers rather than “stress”. Barry Marshall who is credited as one of the discoverers has pointed out that at the time he was introducing the idea “everyone was against me.” In 1847 Ignaz Semmelweiss published data showing that washing hand after leaving the morgue, prior to delivering babies reduced subsequent maternal mortality. His ideas were rejected at the time; a Hungarian in a German establishment.

The RACP has failed to properly evaluate the health effects of AGW. It has not considered the ideas that question the damaging health effects of AGW. It has presented a one sided opinion, and its recommendations should be ignored.

This miscarriage of science ignores the lessons of history. The Royal Australian College of Physicians has become an establishment with a fixed set of ideas that is unwilling to tolerate dissent.

Hmm. How about burn ALL OF THE WORLD'S OIL AT ONCE? Surely, if human activity is responsible for the coming climate disaster...this would be the equivalent of suicide, right? I mean, come on, right? If you are going to convince me that it isn't, this had better be good.""**

Okay. First, why would this be the worst thing? Well, technically it wouldn't be. We could also simultaneously burn all bitumous coal and peat. That would be worse. But the key here is that neither my thought experiment or this one are actually realistic, which is why any of them will suffice as the hypothetical doomsday model. That's because the regular output of CO2 from processes involving refining/combustion of these carbon-rich materials is *incremental*, and the earth has quite natural sinks to sequester carbon, such that atmospheric levels are constantly in flux with ""sunk"" carbon. ([Carbon Cycle](http://microbiologyonlinenotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/the-carbon-cycle.jpg)) To frame the question another way, would immediately releasing *all of the CO2 potential of the entire world's oil supply* ""push"" the equilibrium of the natural cycle and cause the cycle to turn faster? (perhaps not such a bad thing)

Or, is the carbon cycle already ""saturated"" (climate scientists would call this being more ""carbon sensitive""), leaving CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere and wreak the sort of havoc the climate-anxious are so concerned about?

I say let's find out what would happen if we blew the whole fucking thing up. Sometimes, important insights can be gleaned from the extremes. So how much carbon would we add if we burned every last damn drop of the black stuff? Hold in mind for the rest of this journey that we are burning an amount overnight that would fuel current *whole-globe* oil consumption levels for another 45 years (assuming we don't discover more, even though we will).

**Climate Alarmist: ""B-b-b-b-b-but, 45 years!? Ha! We'll be underwater in under 20 years.""**

# (1) Average potential for CO2 release from a barrel of crude oil?

This calculation comes from Dublin-based philosopher and engineer Jim Bliss, in his article [Carbon dioxide emissions per barrel of crude](http://numero57.net/2008/03/20/carbon-dioxide-emissions-per-barrel-of-crude/).

Minimum of **317 kg CO2 per barrel** of crude oil, consumed as the products (by volume, 159 liters per barrel): 44.1% gasoline, 20.8% distillate fuel oil, 9.3% kerosene-type jet fuel, 5.2% residual fuel oil.

# (2) How many barrels on earth?

[OPEC share of world crude oil (2018)](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/330.htm)

There are approximately **1.5 trillion barrels of oil on/in the planet earth**. These are distinguished as ""proven"" barrels, allowing for the fact that there is oil we haven't discovered yet. Interesting note: 80% of the world's oil is in lands owned by OPEC member nations.

# (3) How much CO2 could we potentially release?

1.5e+12 barrels \* 317 kgCO2/barrel  =  **4.755e+14  kg CO2**

# (4) What's the mass of the whole atmosphere of the earth?

[Earth's Atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#cite_note-9)

From the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (Lide, 1996) we get an estimation of the **mass of earth's atmosphere of 5.15e+18 kg.**

# (5) What would this do to current CO2 levels?

It turns out that to do this calculation, you do not have to subtract our current atmospheric CO2 - **at 415 ppm** \- from the total atmospheric mass. It is orders of magnitude smaller and the difference to the total atmospheric mass is negligible. So we'll divide and do some simple addition, assuming no change to the current accepted values for CO2 levels (again, 415 ppm).

4.755e+14  ÷  5.15e+18  =  9.2e-5, or **.0092%**

The mass of the CO2 we'd liberate from burning ALL of the earth's known oil simultaneously would contribute .0092% of the current mass of the atmosphere.

This is **92 ppm (parts per million)**.

**Adding this to the accepted current levels of CO2 we get just over 500 ppm after the event. Let's be \*incredibly\* liberal and say that the answer is between 500-600 ppm CO2 after the event**. This is insanely liberal. At 599 ppm, that is imagining that the world's known total oil supply DOUBLED to 3 trillion barrels, and we ran this calculation again.

You may have an objection to the simple addition of the 92 ppm to 415 ppm. Since we are calculating based on mass, and not actual particle count, it doesn't really matter. I'll deal with some objections below.

# (6) Initial Impression

At a total of just over 500 ppm CO2 after burning ALL oil on earth simultaneously (and allowing for us to burn twice that and still be under 600 ppm), **it is not obvious at all that we are dealing with any kind of man-made climate crisis**, either now or in the future if current fossil fuel use remains the same. Important to note here is that we are assuming a reasonable time scale and a standard concept for biogenic oil (i.e., there is a finite amount of oil in the ground, and we probably won't be using contemporary industrial practices by the time substantially more amounts of oil are created in the earth).

For this to be obvious, you'd have to show that levels of atmospheric CO2 between 500-600 ppm would be a crisis for the planet, and for human life. **I'd posit that it's a crisis for neither, and in fact, it could be a benefit. (More below)**

# Objections

**O: You can't simply add those figures together. Also, your volume calculations shouldn't be on a by-mass basis.**

**A:** Adding those figures is just fine. Even if we had subtracted the current accepted volume of CO2 in the atmosphere from the total mass of the atmosphere prior to doing the calculation, the change would have been negligible. We are able to construe this as adding a new volume of carbon to the existing one. In fact, this model is assuming a steady state for the system, so it distorts the reality to be *worse* than it would actually be, supporting the goal of this whole thought experiment in trying to conceive of the worst-case scenario.

My calculations would be a little more accurate if I had calculated ppm's on the basis of particle count, instead of mass. But most of the atmosphere is diatomic nitrogen and oxygen, and given that CO2 is more massive than both of these, my calculations actually *exaggerate* the changes in volume. On a particle-to-particle basis, the volume change of atmospheric CO2 from burning all oil on earth would be *less* than what I predicted above. The purpose of this exercise was to think about the worst possible scenario, and to judge how truly dire it might be (versus what climate concerned individuals might want you to believe).

**O: You are assuming a uniform dispersion of gas in the atmosphere, which doesn't represent the reality.**

**A:** I don't think this confounds the conclusion, and here's why. We have to think about a couple things having to do with: (a) how atmospheric CO2 is measured, and (b) how CO2 is *actually* distributed in the atmosphere. [https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/news/1](https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/news/1)

If the atmosphere were a static system and just ""sat"" stationary, this assumption of mine might be a problem. The relatively longer lifetime of CO2 in the troposphere and the *horizontal mixing* taking place at the equatorial latitudes, with the tropical transport of equatorial air to extra-tropical latitudes, means that with sufficient time CO2 *does* become fairly evenly distributed. Of course, on a vertical gradient you'd expect to see a tendency for CO2 concentration to increase closer to the surface because of its molecular weight and density being higher than that of the surrounding air. But again, things churn.

Moreover, if federal research groups like the ESRL are taking readings at facilities like the Mauna Loa Observatory at 3400 m to measure atmospheric CO2 levels, then we can gather that the implicit assumption is:  air masses become more representative of the true mean as you get higher (within a certain range). Low elevations and valleys aren't as representative of the ""consensus"" atmosphere most of us are breathing, at least for the purposes of the government, so I accept the assumption. Also, give that I did my calculations by *mass*, and the density of atmosphere decreases with elevation, it seems tenable to assume some proportionality to the mass relationship as a function of elevation (ppms by mass at 1,000 ft probably aren't massively different than at 10,000 ft). That might be confounded by the carbon cycle exchange itself, given that the earth is ""pulling"" CO2 in the opposite direction of the tropical upward mixing. For the sake of this simple exercise, I was willing to say the countervailing forces made things even.

**O: Burning fossil fuels produces other kinds of gas beside CO2, and you didn't account for them.**

**A:** I can't argue with that. It's a fact. But it ignores that water vapor is responsible for the greatest greenhouse effect contribution. [https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse\_data.html](https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html)

Amazingly, many studies totally eliminate the effect of water vapor, for what I consider to be bogus reasons. While attributing up to 85% of green house contribution to water vapor, notice how the following article dismisses it as a possible cause for sustained global warming - [https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2008/02/common-climate-misconceptions-the-water-vapor-feedback-2/](https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2008/02/common-climate-misconceptions-the-water-vapor-feedback-2/) \- namely because of thermal inertia and precipitation. Put another way, water vapor is so short-lived and it's levels so stable in the troposphere, that it's contribution is relatively ""steady"" across time. But with sleight of hand they cite that CO2-driven temperature increase could increase the holding capacity of the atmosphere for water, increasing water vapor and it's greenhouse contribution in what's called *water vapor feedback*. That's interesting, no? Not a chance that the **SUN** could do this, eh? In addition they tend to ignore cloud feedback.

All in all, even groups like the Department of Energy just eliminate water vapor from their calculations, and I think this is absurd. If *any* temperature fluctuations could be impacting water vapor's ability to warm the earth - holding in mind it's relative ability to contribute is 85-95% - it seems ridiculous to toss out water vapor and focus exclusively on CO2.

Other miscellaneous gasses such as CFCs and methane contribute marginally and their sources shouldn't be expected to significantly grow or contribute to radical increase in anthropogenic greenhouse sources.

Other heavier chemicals such as sulfurous dioxides are not, to my knowledge, contributing heavily to the greenhouse effect, *although they are major constituents of smog*. I am not arguing smog and air pollution are not problems, but its important to recognize this transition: **we have moved from a global climate crisis, to local environmental and health crises**. Let's deal with the problems on the proper scale. Scale errors seem to be the endemic conditions of the climate confusion.

**O: You are focusing on absolute CO2 levels and ignoring the importance of the** ***rate*** **of the carbon cycle. ""Shocking"" the cycle by producing CO2 at a rate beyond the earth's ability to ""metabolize"" it is what leads to incremental CO2 backup in the atmosphere, and overall global warming until the process becomes runaway.**

**A:** Prove it. The earth has many dynamic compartments to capture CO2: ocean water, marine deposits on the ocean floor, the vast biome of plant life, soil organic matter, lithospheric stores, etc. It is demonstrable that CO2 levels on this planet have been at *much higher levels in the past*, while life was extant on land. We're talking levels well over 2000 ppm. Hence, the reason for this thought experiment. I wanted to calculate the worst case scenario for anthropogenic green house causes, a situation where we shocked the system by producing as much CO2 as our global oil stores could produce - all at once.

You might argue that the key to past changes in CO2 levels was **incrementalism**. The changes happened gradually enough that countervailing forces like forest expansion could buffer the changes as they happened: slowly. First of all, this is difficult to prove, but it misses my overarching point: *even if* we take this ludicrous hypothetical I suggested as real, we'd expect only to see a rise in global CO2 levels within an upper limit of 600 ppm (probably less).

Can you prove that even an instantaneous increase to these levels would necessarily result in a climatic catastrophe? Perhaps we'd imagine such a sudden change would lead to a large jump in global temperature, but perhaps not; again most models that attempt to prove this ignore solar effects, clouds and water vapor. The point is this lets alone that the reality outside of this ridiculous thought experiment is that our CO2 output is much more gradual. Can you prove that between all of the carbon sinks on the planet earth, whether it be soil or ocean, that these couldn't possibly buffer a change of this size? Can you give good reason why we wouldn't expect the *same* changes that attended past increases in CO2 to also occur today, namely vegetative expansion and higher dissolved ocean CO2? The **CO2 Fertilization effect** is real and demonstrable. Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment experiments have proven increasing CO2 levels result in larger plants, and larger leaf indexes. In other words, we'd likely see concurrent expansion of forests and larger plants.

&gt;Most sources of CO2 emissions are natural, and are balanced to various degrees by natural CO2 sinks. **For example, the natural decay of organic material in forests and grasslands and the action of forest fires results in the release of about 439 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year, while new growth entirely counteracts this effect, absorbing 450 gigatonnes per year.** Although the initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity, modern volcanic activity releases *only* 130 to 230 megatonnes of carbon dioxide each year.

# (7) Final Impressions

It's becoming clear that human perspective/perception fails us past a certain scale-length of reality. It's natural for that to be the case. It wouldn't be any advantage that evolution would particularly favor (at least not until now) individuals with the perceptual mechanisms to really grasp volumes as astonishingly large as the atmosphere or the solid layers of the earth. We think in scales much ""closer to home"", and the bias lends us to sensing our ""power"" is much more substantial than it actually is. We spend so much time looking out into space, at Mars for instance, and the implicit attitudes here are that we have home figured out. Ostensibly, since we ""understand"" it we have some kind of dominion over it, such that all of our Godlike human action could shake the earth from it's orbit, out of it's chaotic stability. The reality is we enlarge our dominion grandly. Our understanding of ourselves and this planet is partial, fragmentary, and for 99.9% of people out there, just plain wrong. The media and it's fear mongering are to blame for a great deal of our fear, as they exploit these biases in our perception.

Current climate models such as the CESM2 (mind you, which deviates by 35% from the past 40 year climate models) predict that an instantaneous rise of atmospheric CO2 by 100% would result in global mean temperature increases of 5.3 deg. C. It should be clear that all of these models are based on time scales which are too short. In larger time scales, our planet is in a relatively cool period, and any current warming trends would not be unexpected. In fact, we might predict they'd be expected. But models like the CESM2 demonstrate why exercises like the one I've taken on here, these highly abstract doomsday scenarios, are only marginally useful for illustration. Our planet has increased in atmospheric CO2 by 50% in the last 300 years, yet we've increased in global mean temperature by 1 deg. C. It is precisely the sort of gradualism that we have to remember, and to bear in mind that this planet is effectively an organism that metabolizes carbon. All of these models do violence to the reality of earth as a chaotically stable system by assuming ""carbon = bad"". This isn't clear. Nor is it clear that disaster is inbound. I hope this thought experiment has at least made that apparent.

# Lastly, Destroying the ""98% of Scientists Agree"" Myth:

This grossly misrepresented statistic originated in a 2009 survey by the American Geophysical Union, and was distributed by University of Illinois researchers P.T. Doran and M.K. Zimmerman. ( [https://archive.is/smQNr](https://archive.is/smQNr) ) The researchers intentionally structured the survey to be as simple as possible, consisting of just two questions, in order to maximize response rate. Those questions were:

(1)  ""*When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?*""

(2)  ""*Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?""*

I can't imagine anyone who would say no to Q1; we had a few preternaturally cold periods, ""Little Ice Ages"", with the last ending in the 19th century. It's obvious we have warmed coming out of an ice age. Per the second question, what does ""significant"" mean? It doesn't ask whether the individual believes the temperature trends are themselves significant. You could answer yes to the question and still think ""So what?"". Also importantly absent: to what human activities specifically would the survey participant attribute these changes?  If you want to make policy decisions based on scientific consensus, this seems like extremely important data to capture.

The survey had a 29% response rate (3000 of 10,257). 82% of the 3,000 answered yes to Q2. **Of these, only the 77 scientists who had at least 50% of their recent papers published in peer-reviewed climate science publications were used to generate the statistic. Of these, 75 answered yes to Q2. This is where we get ""98% of all scientists"". Needless to say, two ""yes"" answers to these two questions by 75 researchers is hardly a consensus among 98% of scientists at large that we are at the beginning of a man-made climate emergency.**

Just recently, a group of over 500 scientists from 14 countries has petitioned the Secretary-General of the UN with a document called the European Climate Declaration, which will be presented is Oslo this month. The declaration which argues that there is NO climate emergency along with it's total list of signees can be read at:  [https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ED-brochureversieNWA4.pdf](https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ED-brochureversieNWA4.pdf)",Truth at the Extremes: Simple Thought Experiment Demonstrates Man-Made Climate Change Alarmism is Absurd,50

Do I mention in emails to profs that I’m applying to both and I would like to work with them under either?

Snags: Lower undergrad GPA, BSc is 3.0 but MSc is 4.0, cumulative 3.55. The Harmonized Scholarship Application (HSA) process deadline is mid September to Jan/Feb, so unless there are suitable international scholarships with deadlines in Spring I’m out of luck for secured funding.  

Pubs: No publications yet but MSc thesis is in the pre print stage and lots of research projects done during MSc, BSc and even high school years under the IBDP and IB MYP programs. 

Contacting prof.s in the SRES, Process Engineering, Law and Environmental faculties for supervisor and committee members. 

Talked to both the IDPhD department and the Engineering dept (never got hold of Chemical), IDPhD said I can go ahead and apply since they do admit lower than cumulative 3.7 GPA if the rest of the app is strong.

I feel that the rest of my app is quite strong, CV with awards, research work, volunteer and leadership work, internships and industrial training, certification in softwares, cover letter, funding proposal and for IDPhD still working on the SIRI. 

And I have a number of profs willing to give me excellent LORs, the strongest of which I’ve included on my Dal apps.

Without secured funding do I have a good chance for either ? 

And any ideas of funding for international student?

This will only get worse and more common. 

Journalists will suffer something similar to PTSD reporting on these disasters repeatedly and will act out accordingly,  increasingly becoming tired and infuriated at the Human race for mostly ignoring it until the issue is right in our face.

ah, right, the problem with that (or giant air conditioners) is we're not destroying the heat, we're simply changing what it effects, so what about a heatsink setup to cool the air, but with the addition of a large chimney that would reach into space past our atmosphere and be able to be sealed airtight on both ends? then we could cool the air and get rid of the unwanted heat by expelling the hot air out of the earth's atmosphere and away from the planet.

we could of course avoid having areas where it's less uniform temperature than desired by simply building more of these to cover a smaller area.

shouldn't that work?

A growing number of international leaders now warn that climate change is, in the words of U.K. Chief Scientific Advisor David King, ""the most severe problem that we are facing today—more serious even than the threat of terrorism.""

1) Scientific and political consensus only achieved by silencing opposition.

2) Alarmism achieved through faulty computer modelling

3) Regular people being blamed for crimes much more likely committed by industrial elites

4) Significant statistical manipulation apparent

5) Need for politics and world government as solution

6) A radical decrease in quality of life for every human on the planet (lockdowns, food shortages, energy crises etc) which will result in many deaths

7) An invisible enemy that, even if real, can never be vanquished. Total control, forever.

8) The solution likely to bring about a problem that might very well never have existed otherwise. The effect proves the cause

9) Social media censorship of citizens questioning or disputing orthodoxy

10) No public debate either held or allowed. Not then and not now.

11) Marketed as greatest existential threats ever experienced.

12) UN-initiated and -led crises (who I believe aren't necessary averse to the idea of world government)

I’ve done my best to assume that - for the sake of argument - these threats are real but, if they should prove not to be...

13) The greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the human race.

Aims: Fascioliasis is a parasitic and zoonotic liver disease that reduces the health and productivity of infected cattle and sheep. In recent years, an observed increase in the prevalence of the disease in Western Africa has been attributed to the changes in regional climatic conditions. This study aims to employ climate predictions to predict future seasonal infection risk in Sokoto State, Nigeria and provide a basis for targeted active disease monitoring to inform the need for control measures.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Geography, School of Science and Engineering, University of Leicester, between November 2014 and October 2018.

Methodology: This study employs the Ollerenshaw index which is commonly used and was modified by Yilma and Malone (1999) to be more suitable for forecasting annual disease risk for Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. Relationships of the annual F. gigantica infection risk between historic climate data from WorldClim for 1970-2000 and future climate scenarios from HADGEM2-ES based on the IPCC greenhouse gas emission scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 from 2050 to 2070 are analysed based on the observed relationships between disease prevalence and climatic conditions in the region.

Results: This study reports on the first analysis of the future seasonal infection risk and shows that seasonal infection risk is expected to spread across Sokoto State from a small patch of outbreaks observed in recent years to larger regions under future climate scenarios. Furthermore, the southern part of the study region exhibits the greatest risk of outbreaks due to its higher rainfall compared to other provinces of Nigeria. This pattern is consistent with the prevalence record obtained during field work in the region in 2016.

Conclusion: This study provides a basis upon which active disease monitoring can be targeted on highlighted areas where control measures need to be put in place.

&gt; The cost of adapting to a changing climate will be 4-5 times higher than what was estimated two years ago, says a new report by the United Nations Environment Programme.

&gt; As India faces more intense and more frequent heat waves, the report says, &amp;quot;Annual costs associated with additional demand for cooling could range between USD25 billion and USD100 billion by mid-century, for low- and high-warming scenarios, respectively.&amp;quot; Recent studies have linked increasing heat waves in India to climate change.

&gt; &amp;quot;It includes a more in-depth review of national-level cost estimates, and global-level, sector specific estimates, while providing additional global-level model estimates,&amp;quot;said Anne Olhoff of UNEP. Commenting on the new UNEP report, Saleemul Haq, Director of Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, told thethirdpole.net, &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s encouraging that the amount has increased in the last few years but it is far clearer that the world is too behind to help out poor and the most vulnerable communities, especially in least developed countries.""

&gt; At the climate summit in Paris last December, it was decided that the Green Climate Fund - designated to provide finance to deal with climate change - would share its budget equally between mitigation and adaptation projects.

&gt; In 2009, world leaders gathered for the climate summit in Copenhagen had promised to provide USD100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects.

&gt; Talking about the situation in Nepal, Madhav Giri, Research Fellow at UNEP&amp;#039;s Global Programme of Research on Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts and Adaptation, said, &amp;quot;Mountainous countries are among the most vulnerable, but they are struggling to get funds to implement their adaptation projects.""

Of course the ""Probably"" (in the title) could not be any further from the truth... (though the author recognizes this)

  
quoted (Umair Haque):

  
""My friends,  catastrophic climate change is not a problem for fascists — it is a  solution. History’s most perfect, lethal, and efficient one means of  genocide, ever, period. Who needs to build a camp or a gas chamber when  the flood and hurricane will do the dirty work for free? Please don’t  mistake this for conspiracism: climate change accords perfectly with the  foundational fascist belief that only the strong should survive, and  the weak — the dirty, the impure, the foul — should perish. That is why  neo-fascists do not lift a finger to stop climate change — but do  everything they can to in fact accelerate it, and prevent every effort  to reverse or mitigate it.

But  I want to tell you the sad, strange, terrible story of how we got here.  Call it a lament for a planet, if you like. You see, not so long ago,  we — the world — were optimistic that climate change could be managed,  in at least some way. The worst impacts probably avoided, forestalled,  escaped — if we worked together as a world. But now we are not so sure  at all. Why is that? What happened? Fascism happened — at precisely the  wrong moment. That shredded all our plans. But fascism happened because capitalism  failed — failed for the world, but succeeded wildly for capitalists.""

1. Studying the concepts and their significance offers highest returns. They can be directly asked as well in reverse or in the form of an application of the concept.

3. Endangered species, Critically endangered species and distribution should be prepared keeping in view their appearance in news.

&gt; Five billion people could be at greater risk of water pollution, coastal storms and under-pollinated crops due to climate change within 30 years, warns a new study.

&gt; Nature&amp;#039;s ability to meet the needs of those who need it the most - such as people in coastal communities or reliant on farming - is dwindling, according to the research.

&gt; The research team set out to understand and map where nature contributes the most to people&amp;#039;s lives, and how many people might be impacted by climate change and changes in the way fossil fuels are used.

&gt; They focussed on three areas in which nature is considered to be hugely beneficial to people - water quality regulation, protection from coastal hazards and crop pollination - and analysed how they might change using open-source software.

&gt; People in Africa and South Asia were projected to be most disadvantaged by &amp;quot;Diminishing contributions&amp;quot; from nature.

&gt; Meanwhile more than 500 million people in coastal communities across the world are estimated to be put at severe risk by sea-level rise by 2050.

She was brought up as a conservative Christian and is now a liberal to moderate Christian; I was brought up as an atheist and am now somewhere between Deism and Norse Heathenry (i.e. I believe that the Abrahamic God is the 'real' god, and I believe in following the Norse/Heathen way of life but I don't believe their gods actually existed). Both of us believe in climate change because we've seen the evidence, but also don't see what climate change has to do with religion or spiritual beliefs. 

We both have families who are Christian, ranging from liberal to conservative, who argue that belief in climate change and taking care of the planet are unchristian values, as compared to the very Christian value of the free market. I can't find a source for this anywhere, biblical or otherwise. I was under the impression that being stewards of the earth and all of God's creation was one of the original commandments. 

Furthermore, is the free market a Christian value? Not trying to stir up trouble, it's just something we've discussed at great length and can't find any biblical evidence for it. Some people we know have made the comparison that Jesus freed people from their chains, and that the modern day equivalent is freeing corporations from government regulation, but we tend to think Jesus would have been either completely apolitical or be more interested in making sure everyone's fed and clothed than making sure business is unregulated. 

Of course, there's no way for either of us to know that, but any and all thoughts on this are welcome. ",Serious: Why do so many Christians argue that belief in climate change is unchristian?,78

I am looking for a bit of a career change and considering some online post grad study in climate change adaptation part time, while I continue working (public service). 

I'm considering either graduate certificate or graduate diplomas in the first instance and then potentially completing the masters if I'm enjoying the work.

**Has anyone completed and can share their experience of any of the following**:

- [Griffith University graduate certificate in climate adaptation](https://www.griffith.edu.au/study/degrees/graduate-certificate-in-climate-change-adaptation-3372)

- [ANU Graduate certificate of climmate policy](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2021/program/CCPOL)

- [Curtin graduate certificate in environment and climate emergency](https://study.curtin.edu.au/offering/course-pg-graduate-certificate-in-environment-and-climate-emergency--gc-envclm/)

**Did anyone find these courses worthwhile, and what employment did they lead to?** I should mention that I come from a humanities background, and so pure science-based degrees aren't really an option for me - I'd be looking more at the policy side of things.

Additionally, a more general question - **what are the odds of securing a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) in any of these courses as a mature age student?** CSP fees are manageable but the full fees are a bit unrealistic.

I finished my undergraduate degree in 2010. Assessment for eligibility appears to be based primarily on academic record, from a cursory look, but seems pretty irrelevant given I finished my degree 12 years ago. What were people's experiences?",Climate change post-grad courses,1

On top of that, I will be the first to admit that I am not a scientist, I do not research climate change, and thus I don't have any strong opinions outside this pretty neutral one. As well as that most people who argue one side or the other are in the same boat as me, not scientists, and never researched. (scientifically, not just googling news articles from their preferred political biased sources)

(And I know I will probably be cursed in the comments as both a climate change denier and a global warming nutjob, but for those of you who aren't blindly faithful I hope do see I am trying to avoid posting any particular arguments of either side and staying neutral and objective)

(Quick edit: I also just want to add that these two groups are not so different outside of their opposing opinion. Preachy, self-righteous, etc. The fact that I have seen both types make the same joke in different ways on certain winter days. You get an extra warm winter day and suddenly proponents are spouting off, ""Yeah, but that global warming's a myth, amiright?"" and you get an extra cold winter day and the deniers start saying, 'Yeah, but that global warming is totally real guise, amiright?"")  


EDIT: Wow, 44% upvoted and a score reading 0, I think I actually got an unpopular opinion. I should post more of my politically neutral objective opinions, this subreddit would suddenly be filled with true unpopular opinions. Guess the only way to be truly unpopular is to not take a side.",Global Warming Proponents are often as bad as climate change deniers.,1

This was brought on by something which happened a few nights ago.

I was out with some friends and the conversation turned to progressive politics and climate change. The group had split up through the bar, and I got into a conversation with one friend who said that he thinks it's the inevitability of his own mortality which stops him from caring about the future, at a fundamental level. I tried to argue that he's just drawing an artificial boundary to the limits of his compassion - he has friends, a partner he loves, and causes he's passionate about. Why does he maintain these things, if he truly believes the inevitability of death makes caring pointless? I think there's an element of the size of the problem which neither of us consciously acknowledged, but either way I couldn't win him over.

We then returned to the bigger group, where a very similar conversation was going on regarding the inevitability of the next ice age, and why should we worry if it's going to happen anyway? The conversation felt extremely similar, and I really didn't know what to say as it felt like an almost identical argument. Plus I was a beer or two past my edge, and was exhausted from just trying to win over my friend.

A few of us on the ""why you should care"" side tried a few different angles, but didn't really get anywhere. For me personally, I just really struggled to relate to someone saying that they couldn't find reasons to care about a future they're not going to be a part of, and I really struggled to reach across the divide.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to get through to people like this? Or similar stories on how they dealt with this personally?","How do you deal with ""inevitability arguments"" when talking about climate change?",3

&gt; BERLIN - Young German activists who have staged weekly &amp;quot;School strikes&amp;quot; to bring attention to climate change issued demands Monday that would require Germany&amp;#039;s government to adopt measures far more ambitious than current plans for to curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt; The six key actions listed by Fridays For Future, the group that organized the strikes by secondary school and university students, include moving forward the timeline for Germany to phase-out coal-fired power plants.

&gt; The student group said it instead wants one-quarter of coal-fired power stations switched off this year and the rest by 2030.The group also said Germany should generate all of its energy from renewable sources and cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2035; end billions of euros worth of annual fossil fuel subsidies; and introduce a carbon tax of 180 euros per metric ton.

&gt; Thousands of scientists have publicly backed the student protests, saying Germany can&amp;#039;t reach the goal with current policies.

&gt; The group&amp;#039;s demands are unlikely to find favour with German businesses, which already are wary of the rising cost of energy.

&gt; Reas Kuebler, a spokesman for Germany&amp;#039;s Environment Ministry, declined to comment directly on the protesters&amp;#039; demands, but said the government was focused on implementing the coal panel&amp;#039;s recommendations.

*****
&gt; For the parks in the &amp;quot;Extreme&amp;quot; category, they found that &amp;quot;The onset of spring is earlier than 95 percent of the historical range,&amp;quot; says Jake Weltzin, an ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey and one of the authors of the report.

&gt; In Saguaro National Park, Arizona, near where Weltzin lives, one of the invasive species that park staff struggle with most is buffelgrass.

&gt; Another problem that earlier springs present for parks is a mismatch between plants and pollinators.

&gt; &amp;quot;The national parks is just sort of the first application. As we go along, we hope to be able to apply this to the national wildlife refuges and other protected areas.""

&gt; The purpose of the current report is to give staff at individual parks a sense of how climate change is affecting their sites, rather than make prescriptions about how parks should deal with this change.

&gt; Given the diverse ecosystems among the more than 250 parks surveyed, more research is needed to determine the more specific ways in which climate change is affecting particular parks.

In a joint communiqué released at the end of their summit in Rome, the G20 leaders said they would end the financing of coal power plants overseas, but the statement included no new commitments on curbing the use of coal domestically.

The communiqué also sent an important symbolic message as United Nations-led climate talks get underway this week in Glasgow. The leaders pledged to “pursue efforts” to limit the global average temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, compared to preindustrial times.

But the world is currently not on track to achieve that goal, which scientists say is necessary to avert the worst effects of climate change. This stark fact hangs over the Glasgow climate summit, raising fears that the summit will yield similar half-steps.

Beyond vague if well-meaning targets, what matters are concrete measures that countries are taking to rein in the emissions of planet-warming gases more quickly.

“We remain committed to the Paris Agreement goal to hold the global average temperature increase well below 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels,” the final statement read, referring to the agreement among world nations to work together to cut emissions to limit global warming.

To actually achieve the 1.5 degree target, countries in the group would have to strengthen their national climate targets. The existing country commitments put the world on a path to far higher levels of warming, with the global average temperature rising by 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, which would put the world on a path to far more harrowing heat waves, fires and flooding.

Nor did the G20 agree to specific financial arrangements to encourage emerging economies to make the energy transition away from fossil fuels.

I don't know if Isaac Arthur has made any changes on his thoughts on this, but I thought the way in which aliens being mad or disappointed at our ecological destruction was simply dismissed as if it was a third world village having poor agricultural techniques is a bit short-sighted (this happens at around 9:30 in the video). 

True, even advocates for rapid phasing out of fossil fuels tend to agree that we cannot do so overnight, but the reasoning tends to be circular: economic growth would stagnate and people in power don't have *that* much political capital. 

This is not to mention the way in which either countries or individuals (or corporations, for that matter) are incentivized to compete in a way that is adverse to collective well-being in this regard. Yes, these may be the result of societal drift, locking us into this problem long before we had much of a way to see it coming, but we are not altogether hopeless in changing society. 

The technology for dealing with climate change is here, all that's truly required is the political will to go through with it. We don't need advanced aliens to give us a magical MacGuffin that will solve climate change for us, though if they could do so without growing pains, that would obviously be ideal. 

Isaac Arthur does frequently mention the possibility of hive minds who would simply have no concept of individuality and so to them the problem (perhaps a minor filter?) of divided political will is not a problem at all. But other than that, I don't think it makes sense to see non-hivemind aliens as simply having followed our exact societal footsteps. They might have some concept of expansive growth as would be required of the Darwinian principles, but their society or psyche might have simply adapted to overcome climate change, rather than the solution being entirely technological.

&amp;#x200B;

Again sorry if this is already discussed in another video, I haven't had time to watch all of them. Do correct me if that's the case. Love the content, this is simply a pondering I had about this notion of aliens who were mad for one reason or another that we were destroying our climate, and what we actually could do about it if anything.","Climate change in ""Stupid Aliens""",28

As far as I can tell, cities are false efficiency all the way down, and result in nothing more than a few million extra take-out containers going into the landfill everyday.

Hm. I would still think putting people in closer proximity to one another would at least offer some efficiency in terms of shipping routes and things like that. And take-out containers, sure, maybe...but are those really worse than grocery bags? Especially given that I can walk to all the restaurants AND grocery stores in my neighborhood. Restaurants operate on an economy of scale compared with household kitchens. Not to mention that my city has municipal compost so all those takeout containers end up in the earth, not the landfill. But anyway I suppose these are all empirical questions, not something to be answered by speculation.

You might want to reconsider this, since these programs stimulate the economy from the bottom and therefore encourage directionless economic activity.

Yeah if I'm going to reconsider a basic philosophical position I'd need a reason less abstract than this.

if you leave a patch of land unmolested, it grows over with weeds and this concentrates moisture, after which point the trees return. Takes about five to seven years.

I'll buy that in moist, temperate zones. But in land with rapidly encroaching desertification, it seems like more action is needed. But I'm not an expert so who knows, maybe you're right.

The intentions are good but the results do not match.

Most philosophies produce mixed results.

1) I'm selfish and want to keep driving Hummers and buying oil stocks. No issue there, humans are selfish but disbelieving doesn't help the stock price so?

2) Everything is fine, the world isn't ending. This one feels like a safety mechanism which is kinda ok as well, but I'm not sure these types of people would defend 'everything is fine' with such fervor.

3) Nothing I can do about it, the top 10 companies contribute 70% of the emissions. Also reasonable, but disbelieving doesn't change the facts as well.

So I'm not sure there's a valid reason to WANT to disbelieve climate change, can someone help?",What are the advantages of NOT believing in climate change?,2

Farmers in Pinal County, Arizona, knew they were taking a risk nearly two decades ago when they agreed to be among the first people to lose water from the Colorado River if there were a shortage.

“They were talking about charging us full cost for water, and farmers just couldn't afford that, ” Arnold Burruel said, looking at the concrete canal slicing a blue ribbon through the dusty landscape. To get a cheaper supply, farmers signed a shorter-term agreement, knowing they were betting on how long water would last.

The canal near Burruel’s farm in Eloy, Arizona, is a tiny piece of the Central Arizona Project, a vast 336-mile network of pumps, tunnels, and pipelines that transports close to 500 billion gallons of water each year from the Colorado River. CAP moves this immense amount of water across the desert and 3000 feet uphill to Arizona’s densely populated central corridor, where 80% of the state’s residents live. Transporting so much water makes CAP the largest power user in the state.

“When I got into farming here, CAP was just coming in and Pinal County was a wasteland — just dry desert with irrigation ditches running everywhere, ” Burruel said, driving through his 2200-acre farm filled with emerald green Bermuda grass, which he sells for horse feed. “I started buying land here because it was so cheap, and nobody had any confidence.”

*****
&gt; A new study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science shows that the climate denial echo chamber organizations funded by ExxonMobil and Koch family foundations produced misinformation that effectively polluted mainstream media coverage of climate science and polarized the climate policy debate.

&gt; The analysis of 20 years&amp;#039; worth of data by Yale University researcher Dr. Justin Farrell shows beyond a doubt that ExxonMobil and the Kochs are the key actors who funded the creation of climate disinformation think tanks and ensured the prolific spread of their doubt products throughout our mainstream media and public discourse.

&gt; Corporate funding likely influences the nature and content of polarizing texts pertaining to climate change, according to a study.

&gt; Political polarization has become a hallmark of climate change policy discussion, with multiple groups in various sectors contributing to public discourse regarding climate and energy.

&gt; To quantify the influence of corporate funding in climate change discourse, Justin Farrell analyzed more than 39 million words of text produced by 164 organizations active in the climate change counter-movement between 1993 and 2013.

&gt; The results suggest quantitative evidence of the influence of funding in the climate change debate that had previously been hypothesized, and suggests an analytical model for integrating texts with the social networks that created them, according to the author.

&gt; The German government has been accused of &amp;quot;Pure play hypocrisy&amp;quot; for complaining of the impacts of climate change brought by this week&amp;#039;s catastrophic flooding while signalling support for a new gas project in the Arctic.

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s interior minister Horst Seehofer has directly labelled the &amp;quot;Extreme weather&amp;quot; that has already killed at least 100 people and devastated homes as a &amp;quot;Consequence of climate change&amp;quot; - and the environment minister Svenja Schulze yesterday declared &amp;quot;Climate change has arrived in Germany&amp;quot;.

&gt; Their government is considering committing $300m towards a Russian-led liquefied natural gas project in the Siberian Arctic, known as Arctic LNG II. Europe&amp;#039;s flooding crisis - follow live updates.

&gt; The green politician told Sky News: &amp;quot;Arctic LNG II is a concrete example of the hypocrisy of some of our leaders. The disasters in Germany and Belgium show us that climate change is here and now, and that it is urgent to act.""

&gt; Regine Richter, from German environmental NGO Urgewald, said: &amp;quot;Complaining about climate change and the damage it does while supporting a new gas project in the arctic is pure play hypocrisy.""

&gt; &amp;quot;If Germany supports the project through an export credit guarantee it is blatantly contradicting any climate ambition proclaimed by the government,&amp;quot; she added.

**- Club of Rome**  
**The First Global Revolution**

The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.  


Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?   


While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the [The Club of Rome](http://www.clubofrome.org/) (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.   


I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that ""*we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse*"" and ""*our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth*."" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of [supporting organisations](http://www.green-agenda.com/greenweb.html) just for fun **or** they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviours of Gaia.  


Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government policy – well, I have become personally convinced that they are deadly serious. On this website I try to use quotes and excerpts as much as possible and let the reader reach their own conclusions.  


So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members? Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as ""*a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity.*"" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.  


The Club of Rome subsequently [founded](http://web.archive.org/web/20051119085836/http://www.fondamental.com/en/eclub2.htm) two sibling organizations, the [Club of Budapest](http://www.clubofbudapest.org/index.php) and the [Club of Madrid](http://www.clubmadrid.org/). The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold [joint meetings](http://web.archive.org/web/20051119081827/http://www.fondamental.com/en/eclubbud.htm) and [conferences](http://www.gfna.net/eventdetail.php?id=14&amp;). As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 [National Associations.](http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/national_associations/addresses.asp) Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. [USACOR](http://www.usacor.org/), [CACOR ](http://www.cacor.ca/)etc).  


I would like to start this analysis of the Club of Rome by listing some prominent members of the CoR and its two sub-groups, the Clubs of Budapest and Madrid. Personally it isn’t what the CoR is that I find so astonishing; it is **WHO** the CoR is! This isn’t some quirky little group of green activists or obscure politicians. They are the most senior officials in the United Nations, current and ex-world leaders, and the founders of some of the most influential environmental organisations. When you read their reports in the context of who they are – its gives an entirely new, and frightening, context to their extreme claims.

***and many more….***  


The concept of 'environmental sustainability' was first brought to widespread public attention in 1972 by the Club of Rome in their book entitled [*The Limits to Growth*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_Growth). The official summary can be read [here](http://www.clubofrome.org/docs/limits.rtf). The report basically concluded that the growth of the human population, and an increase in prosperity, would cause an ecological collapse within the next hundred years:  


“*If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather* ***sudden and uncontrollable decline*** *in both population and industrial capacity*.”   


“***It is possible to alter these growth trends*** *and to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future. The* ***state of global equilibrium could be designed*** *so that the basic material needs of each person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize his individual human potential*.”   


“*The overwhelming growth in world population caused by the positive birth-rate loop is a recent phenomenon, a result of mankind's very successful reduction of worldwide mortality.* ***The controlling negative feedback loop has been weakened****, allowing the positive loop to operate virtually without constraint. There are only two ways to restore the resulting imbalance. Either the birth rate must be brought down to equal the new, lower death rate, or* ***the death rate must rise again***.”  


“***The result of stopping population growth in 1975 and industrial capital growth in 1985*** *with no other changes is that population and capital reach constant values at a relatively high level of food, industrial output and services per person. Eventually, however, resource shortages reduce industrial output and* ***the temporarily stable state degenerates***.”  


“*Man possesses, for a small moment in his history, the most powerful combination of knowledge, tools, and resources the world has ever known. He has all that is physically necessary to* ***create a totally new form of human society*** *- one that would be built to last for generations. The two missing ingredients are a realistic, long-term goal that can* ***guide mankind to the equilibrium society*** *and the Human Will to achieve that goal*.”  


“*Without such a goal and a commitment to it, short-term concerns will generate the exponential growth that drives the world system toward the limits of the earth and* ***ultimate collapse****. With that goal and that commitment,* ***mankind would be ready now to begin a controlled, orderly transition from growth to global equilibrium***.”  


So as you can see the even back in 1972 the Club considered modern industrial society to be completely unsustainable. They state that even if population was frozen at 1975 levels, and industrial activity at 1985 levels, then the earth’s ecosystems would still ultimately collapse. The CoR has not changed these views in the slightest, in fact, in the last three decades their warnings have become increasingly more urgent and alarmist. They call this imminent collapse the ‘[World Problematique](http://www.clubofrome.org/about/world_problematique.php)’ and their proposed solution the ‘[World Resolutique](http://www.uia.be/en/node/159?kap=24).’  


The *Limits to Growth* is considered to be the most successful environmental publication ever produced and propelled the Club of Rome to its current position of an environmental thought-leader and a major consultant to the United Nations. It has been translated into more than forty languages and sold more than 30 million copies. Throughout the 1970s and 80s the concept that humanity was irreparably damaging the earth gained popularity and facilitated the formation of mainstream and activist environmental groups.   


All meetings of the CoR are held ‘behind closed doors’ and no public records are kept. However the Club does produce many ‘[discussion reports](http://www.clubofrome.org/archive/reports.php)’ that can be found on its website. The United Nations [contracts](http://erc.unesco.org/ong/en/directory/ONG_Desc_portal.asp?mode=gn&amp;code=908) the Club of Rome to prepare ‘Policy Guidance Documents’ which it uses in formulating its policies and programmes. A quick search for Club of Rome on the [UNESCO publications](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;mode=e&amp;set=47F6CA01_2_151&amp;tx_d=1&amp;look=new&amp;sc1=1&amp;sc2=1&amp;lin=1&amp;nl=1&amp;gp=1&amp;ll=1&amp;scroll=1) site reveals 250 such documents. There are many other documents there authored by CoR members acting in other capacities. As many high ranking UN officials are actually CoR members, this is like a man asking himself for advice, and then agreeing with that advice. Not very objective! Various UN organisations also hold [joint conferences](http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=18127&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html) with the CoR.  


While checking the Club of Rome website this morning the first item in their ‘current news’ section refers to a briefing delivered by the [CoR to G8 officials ](http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/g8plus5/)in preparation for the upcoming G8 meeting. The second item is a summary report from the Club of Romes ’[strategy planning retreat](http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/cor_news_bank/12/)’ with 150 senior UNESCO officials. The joint CoR/UNESCO communique states:  


“*We are at the end of an era – a turning point in history. We are approaching the threshold of runaway climate change.* ***We underline the urgency of radical action to reduce emissions****, by both immediate action and longer-term measures; to stress to political leaders the non-linear nature of the processes at work which will generate sudden change; and to assert that the overriding priority must be to avert the impending risk of catastrophic climate change.*” - CoR/UNESCO communique  


Twenty years after the *Limits to Growth* the CoR published another major report that became an instant best-seller. In *The First Global Revolution* the Club of Rome claimed that the time to act had run out. It was now or never. Delay in beginning corrective measures will increase the damage to the world ecological system and ultimately reduce the human population that will eventually be supportable. They also stated that democratic governments are far too short-sighted to deal with the ‘problematique’ and new forms of governance are urgently required.  


In order not too violate any copyright protection I will not reproduce the text of the book on this site. However, it is permissible for me to quote a brief excerpt in the context of this wider discussion. The complete [text](http://books.google.com/books?id=8RNKHGbzUuAC&amp;printsec=frontcover) (third ed.) can be read and searched online at Google Books. As you read the following quote (from page 75, first ed.), please remember the names of the leaders listed above. This is not some quirky little cult. This is the [stated agenda ](http://green-agenda.com/index.html)of the leaders of the environmental movement:   


“***This is the way we are setting the scene for mankind’s encounter with the planet****. The opposition between the two ideologies that have dominated the 20th century has collapsed, forming their own vacuum and leaving nothing but crass materialism.*  


*It is a law of Nature that any vacuum will be filled and therefore eliminated unless this is physically prevented. “Nature,” as the saying goes, “abhors a vacuum.” And people, as children of Nature, can only feel uncomfortable, even though they may not recognize that they are living in a vacuum.* ***How then is the vacuum to be eliminated?***   


*It would seem that humans need a common motivation, namely* ***a common adversary****, to organize and act together in the vacuum; such a motivation must be found to bring the divided nations together to face an outside enemy,* ***either a real one or else one invented for the purpose****.*  


*New enemies therefore have to be identified.*  
*New strategies imagined, new weapons devised.*  


***The common enemy of humanity is man.***  


***In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.*** *All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.* ***The real enemy then, is humanity itself.***  


*The old democracies have functioned reasonably well over the last 200 years, but they appear now to be in a phase of complacent stagnation with little evidence of real leadership and innovation*  


***Democracy is not a panacea****. It cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits. These facts must be faced squarely. Sacrilegious though this may sound,* ***democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead****. The complexity and the technical nature of many of today’s problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time.*”  


So, long before Global Warming became a well known issue Al Gore and his Club of Rome colleagues stated that they would use the threat of global warming to unite humanity and ""*set the scene for mankind's encounter with the planet.*"" In the same way that shamans and sooth-sayers in medieval times used their advance knowledge of when eclipses would occur to control and terrify their followers, they would use a natural phenomenon as their 'enemy' to achieve their objectives. But then they state that although Global Warming would be presented as the initial enemy, the real enemy of humanity would be portrayed as man himself. I am already noticing how frequently the terms climate change and overpopulation are being uttered in the same breath.  


Having discovered that all these influential environmental leaders were associated with the Club of Rome I set about reading all the reports, lectures and speeches on their website as well as the reports commissioned by the UN. I was amazed to find that they lay out their entire agenda for anyone who has eyes to see. Exactly the same themes, concepts and phrases are repeated continuously throughout their publications. They are full of references to '*imminent collapse*', '*dying planet*', '*our mother Gaia*', '*wrenching transformation*', '*united global society*', '*global consciousness*', '*new forms of governance*' etc. They truly intend to bring about the world's *First Global Revolution*.  


The [Kosmos Journal ](http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo2/about/partners/index.shtml)provides perhaps the best insight into their worldview. This Journal was founded by the Club of Rome in partnership with with several of its sibling organizations. As described in my article, [The Green Web](http://green-agenda.com/greenweb.html), the CoR has established a network of supporting organizations, each focusing on a different aspect of their agenda. The Kosmos Journal contains many articles written by CoR members. The basic premise of their worldview is:   


*""Modern industrial civilisation is fast outstripping the Earth's natural regenerative and life-supporting capacity...""*  


*""At current rates of resource depletion and environmental degradation a near complete collapse of ecological integrity will occur within the next 100 years...""*   


*""Gaia, our Mother, who nutured humanity for countless millenia within her womb of evolution, is dying...""*  


*“A small window of opportunity now exists to transform humanity into a sustainable global interdepedant society based on respect and reverence for Earth...""*   


*""A radical change from the current trajectory is required, a complete reordering of global society...""*  


*""Humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy...""*  


*""At this time a new enemy must be found, one either real or invented for the purpose...""*   


*""Democracy has failed us, a new system of global governance, based on environmental imperatives, must be implemented quickly...""*  


Now that Obama is firmly ensconced in the White House the Club of Rome and its affiliates are swinging into high gear. The CoR recently unveiled a new 3-year programme entitled [A New Path for World Development](http://www.clubofrome.org/eng/new_path/). The Club of Madrid has launched the [Road to Copenhagen](http://www.roadtocopenhagen.org/), a joint programme with the UN Environment Programme intended to facilitate a binding global climate change treaty in 2009. Perhaps most interesting is the [State of Global Emergency ](http://www.worldshiftnetwork.org/declaration/index.html)declared by the Club of Budapest in October 2008. The declaration states that we only have **four or five years** to prevent a total collapse of the Earth's ecosystems. To quote from the [document](http://www.worldshiftnetwork.org/media/downloads/declaration.pdf):  


“*If we continue on our present unsustainable path,* ***by mid-century the Earth may become largely uninhabitable for human and most other forms of life****. Such a total systems collapse could occur much sooner, however, due to* ***runaway global warming*** *or other ecocatastrophes, and/or by nuclear wars triggered by religious, ethnic or geopolitical conflicts or access to diminishing natural resources. The macro-trends driving these global threats and challenges have been apparent for decades and are now building toward a threshold of irreversibility. The scientific modeling of complex systems shows that when systems reach a state of critical instability, they either break down to their components or break through to a higher order of integral functioning. At these “****points of no return****” maintaining the status quo, or returning to a previous mode of organization and functioning, are not a feasible option.*  


*The acceleration of critical trends and cross-impacts among them indicates that the ‘window of opportunity’ for pulling out of the present global crisis and breaking through to a more peaceful and sustainable world is likely to be* ***no more than four to five years*** *from the end of 2008.* ***This is close in time to the Mayan 2012 prophecy for the end of the current world****. The period around the end of 2012 is likely to be a turbulent one for this and other reasons. Predictions coming from the physical sciences foresee disturbances in the geomagnetic, electromagnetic and related fields that embed the planet causing significant damage to telecommunications and impacting many aspects of human activity and health.* ***For the esoteric traditions the end of 2012 will be the end of the known world, although the more optimistic intepretations speak of a new world taking the place of the old***.”  


This may seem very strange – a group of prominent world leaders talking about ancient Mayan prophecies, but as I describe in my article, [Gaia's Gurus](http://www.green-agenda.com/gaians.html), many leading global warming activists openly advocate earth-reverence and other New Age philosophies. **Gaia, Global Warming, and Global Governance** are intricately entwined, if one truly believes in Gaia, and that she is being fatally harmed by the current system, then a new system of global governance and control would appear to be the only answer. Global Warming provides the ideal 'enemy' to bring about this objective. It is easy for these global elitists to talk about sacrifice, wrenching transformation, population reduction and eliminating the use of fossil fuels but the implications are truely horrendous.  


Even if you think this is all nonsense I would ask you to at least read [these quotes and excerpts](http://green-agenda.com/index.html), and think about the implications of their agenda. Everyday I am amazed at how quickly things are changing. It is coming hard and fast. It's almost like reading a book and then watching the television adaptation, except that this adaptation is not a movie - it's on the evening news. As Al Gore said in the closing sentence of his statement after he won the Nobel Peace Prize ... ""***This is just the beginning***.""

Climate change is real and serious. There's no shortage of stats, videos and articles on this topic. I know we all agree on it's negative impact on planet Earth, but feel there isn't much we can do. We can do some stuff on a personal level here and there and be cautious of waste, etc. But when it comes to changing public policies or holding companies and governments accountable, we feel that is not something we can do. On an individual level, no. However as a community on a larger level we can.

Avaaz has done some excellent work over the years and I feel with their support we can stand tall and start making a change. Even if it's a change in awareness and perception of the issue. 

I'm volunteering and organizing a few things for the September 21st turnout. If any volunteers are interested please let me know. Our Mississauga team has some great ideas but are short staffed. I'm looking for people to do all kinds of things. From simply showing up, signing a petition, to taking on bigger roles. We can't do this with out you.

I started a thread to discuss the EU migration crisis in the context of climate change about two weeks ago. During the discussions, I said that [I might start similar threads to discuss how Russia and China might deal with climate change migrants](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/91p63g/eu_migration_crisis_general_discussion/e323rst/). Instead, I decided to start a series about climate change in general, which I hope contributors such as /u/ZeroMikeEchoNovember, /u/cherrykirsche, /u/Dr_Gonzoh, and others who share my interest in looking at how climate change will affect the grand chessboard will find useful or interesting. 

This post is the first post in a weekly series that will serve as discussion-starters for how climate change will affect the geopolitics of various countries and regions. In each of the posts, I will provide a general introduction to the region/country (with links to credible sources), provide figures, and pose several questions. These will serve as the basic starter kits for the discussions. Because I'm just a casual dabbler in the field of IR and geopolitics, these posts are learning experiences, so bear with me. I hope these discussions will be less prone to vote-manipulation and brigading (which seems especially prevalent in recent China-related posts), which is why I was wondering if the moderators would be kind enough to put posts in this series in '[contest mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012/comments/159bww/introducing_contest_mode_a_tool_for_your_voting/)'.

#Geopolitics and Climate Change: China

&amp;nbsp;

**General Introduction**

China is currently the most populous country on the planet, with a population of [1.4 billion](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=CN&amp;year_high_desc=true) as of 2017. Its population is expected to have reached a plateau and will not see significant change through 2050, when it will begin to gradually decline, reaching roughly 1 billion in 2100, [according to the UN Population Division's projection's medium fertility variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant\)). The country has received a [demographic dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China) from its One-Child Policy, but seemingly [must return it with interest](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2130737/why-china-must-wake-demographic-reality) as its population rapidly ages at a geopolitically-critical period when it needs to sustain its economic growth.

Since 2000, the country has been a net importer of [agricultural products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_China) due to [depletion of its main aquifers](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100713/full/466308a.html). There is [strong consensus](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19605) that [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources_of_China) is [already](https://www.ft.com/content/3ee05452-1801-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44) facing [a](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/21/asia/china-water-crisis/index.html) water [crisis](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/china-has-a-water-crisis-how-can-it-be-solved/) even before the effects of climate change have truly been felt. Naturally, China has been looking to solve the problem, though whether or not the problem can be solved and whether or not the attempted solutions (like drastic geoengineering) will lead to unexpected consequences remains to be seen.

China is the [world's second largest economy by nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China), though many, including [prominent Chinese officials](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/11/02/is-china-cooking-the-books-on-economic-expansion), have stated that the numbers have been inflated and are unreliable. In contrast, China's per capita GDP is ranked 71st, indicating that China's economic strength comes from its massive population. China was the world's fastest growing economy until recently. It is currently engaged in [a massive economic and infrastructure project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative) that spans the Eurasian supercontinent.

By some measures, the country is considered [a leader in science and technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_China), with some saying that it might become [a superpower in science and innovation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/these-charts-show-how-china-is-becoming-an-innovation-superpower/), though its firms and institutions are plagued with [academic dishonesty](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-science/china-issues-rules-to-get-tough-on-academic-integrity-idUSKCN1IW01O), [intellectual property theft](https://law.stanford.edu/2018/04/10/intellectual-property-china-china-stealing-american-ip/), and [corruption](https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1424571/fraud-academia-killing-chinas-nobel-dream). The lack of strong fundamentals in Chinese [science](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/gauging-the-strength-of-chinese-innovation) and technology, has made it dependent on the west --especially the US-- for its core technologies, and this was exemplified by the effects of the [recent American ban on telecoms giant ZTE](https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2153618/china-reliant-us-core-technology-some-time-so-world). China excels at completing megaprojects, which is especially relevant to managing the effects of climate change.

China is currently [the largest emitter of greenhouse gases by a wide margin](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions), generating roughly double the amount of carbon dioxide than the next largest producer, the United States, despite having taken steps to reduce emissions. Climate change is expected to have a strong impact on China, as it is already struggling to meet water demands while [global water reserves continue to be depleted](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/earth-running-out-water-aquifiers/396152/), and [a very recent study from MIT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05252-y) concluded that if the world continues down the ""business-as-usual"" path, the North China Plain --the population and agricultural heartland of China-- will regularly see a [wet bulb temperature (WBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature) greater than 35 degrees Celsius, rendering it effectively uninhabitable (""A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people, unclothed in the shade next to a fan""), on top of affecting crop yields. China is set to see 67 million displaced by rising sea levels, 400 million potentially affected by an uninhabitable climate, and millions more who will likely be hit by abnormal natural disasters. Given the large Chinese diaspora worldwide, it is likely that China will see an increased outflow of migrants.

Historically, China has been very protective of its sovereignty, and [Confucian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism) culture (which is the cultural core of East Asian countries) is less keen on accepting immigrants than others. This is illustrated by the ethnic makeup of Japan ([reportedly 98.5% Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Japan)), Korea ([96% Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea#Ethnic_groups)), Taiwan ([95% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Taiwan#Ethnicity)), and China ([91% Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China_and_Taiwan)). With its agricultural and water supplies already under stress, it is unlikely that China will welcome any significant amount of refugees. China shares borders with many small countries and is within a short distance from many more. Of its neighbors, India is the most populous, and is expected to become the largest country by population by 2025, and one report deems it as [the most vulnerable country to climate change](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-hsbc/india-most-vulnerable-country-to-climate-change-hsbc-report-idUSKBN1GV20Z). Given its prominence in the region, it seems possible that China will face a refugee crisis, though the viable routes should make it easy to defend against (assuming western China is unviable for travel). It is unclear to this writer whether China has a strong pull factor in neighboring countries, like what Europe has in Africa and the Middle East.

**Questions:**

* What are China's prospects for solving its agricultural and water problems?

* Will China's massive population, which has been a major source of leverage for the country in business deals, act as a double-edged sword and become a major burden due to climate change?

* If the above is true, how might China deal with the problem? Would it ""cut a pound of flesh"" from itself? Would it attempt to flex its economic muscles? Would it break character and [take the now-fertile Russian land west of the Urals](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/why-china-will-reclaim-siberia)?

* Will China face a climate refugee problem from nearby states?

* In general, how well do you think China will weather climate change, assuming no major geopolitical event occurs?",[Series] Geopolitics and Climate Change: China,152

*****
&gt; In a study of middle-class consumption in 215 cities around the world, UBS analysts found spending priorities were noticeably different in cities most at risk from climate change such as Los Angeles, Tokyo and Shanghai.

&gt; The report said middle-class households are already changing their lifestyles in the cities most exposed to hotter temperatures, rising sea levels and extreme weather such as storms and floods.

&gt; In cities that suffer extreme heat, the middle-class is increasingly laying out for air conditioning, the report noted.

&gt; The largest cities are home to nearly a quarter of the global population and generate around half of global GDP, the report said.

&gt; The political and social clout of middle-class populations means their vulnerability to climate change risks should translate into pressure on governments to tackle global warming, the report noted.

&gt; &amp;quot;The middle class has two important qualities that make them critically important to the conversation about climate change: substantial assets and political influence,&amp;quot; said Paul Donovan, global economist and managing director at UBS Investment Bank.

I remember reading an article a while back about an incident before Pope Francis released his stance on climate change, about Pope Francis wanting to talk to a scientist to understand the climate change. I remember reading from the perspective of the scientist who decided, moments before the meeting, to not talk about the science but tell the Pope that climate change is a fundamental moral issue, and that it is the poorest people that suffer the most from climate change. If someone could link me the article from the scientist's perspective, I would be very grateful.

Majestic sequoia trees can live for thousands of years. Climate change could wipe them out

Sequoias were once found across the Northern Hemisphere, but today, they only naturally grow across the western slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.

There are only around 48000 acres of sequoia groves left in the world, and the trees are now facing threats from human-made climate change in several ways.

Scientists say that climate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense. Fires in June this year in the Western states would have been ""virtually impossible"" without human-made climate change, according to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at the World Weather Attribution project.

""A giant sequoia that was weakened by drought was then subject to impacts by the bark beetle, which then further weakened the tree and made it more susceptible to mortality from fire"" he said.

Hodder described the Castle Fire as something not witnessed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

""This was the first time that the fire got big and hot enough to get into the crowns of multiple giant sequoia and kill them"" he said.

Sequoias have survived many a drought before, and even those that were spared from the Castle Fire are showing clear signs of stress. Christy Brigham, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks' chief of resource management and science, said the trees were shedding their needles because it's too dry.

The trees have recovered from previous droughts, Brigham said, ""but if climate change continues and droughts become more severe, they may not be able to survive."" she said.

To know what these trees have survived, researchers turn to dendrochronology, the science of studying tree rings, which Clay Jordan refers to as the sequoias' ""journals.""

Biologists can look at those rings and work out when it might have been affected by fire or period(...)

I just....I thought this was an issue that was really starting to matter to people on the scale that it has mattered to me ever since I learned about it when I was a kid, but it doesn't seem like people care enough about it to compromise and vote for people they're not in love with who are committed to doing something about it. And, I can't stress this enough, it's not a matter of one party wanting to do something and the other party wanting to do nothing, it's one side wanting to do something and the other side wanting to actively make the situation worse. And the people on the left who I thought were whole heartedly on board with trying to help resolve and mitigate the effects of it just don't even care enough to even speak of it now that Bernie is gone. Instead it's this weird discussion of taking to the streets to do something, not much detail there, because they're mad about progressive socialism not getting enough mainstream appeal to give everything or even a ton of what they want. I get it, I just think that not continually compromising to get some of what you want is a great way of getting none of what you want. And I'm just disappointed, I'm disappointed that climate change doesn't actually seem to fucking matter the way I thought it did to people that claimed they want to do stuff about it and they care deeply about it.

Honestly the same thing can be said about health care. Trump wants to take access away from millions, and Biden wants to improve the ACA. It's not as good, or affordable, as M4A, but getting better access to health care is a ton better than millions of people having their access to health care getting taken from them.","Listening to the episode ""Turning Skills into Action"" and I'm struck by how little climate change seems to matter",13

This is my first time coming to this subreddit and posting, and I need some people who understand and can give me some support. 

I’m in my early 30’s and have a lot of anxiety around growing old in a world with crises like water shortages, extreme weather changes, etc (edit to add I also have generalized anxiety). I’ve tried bringing it up to those around me and either they downplayed the reality of it or were too pessimistic instead of helping support me.

I am currently going through some big decisions that include considering whether I want to move back to my home state, which gets very hot for a good part of the year. But I legitimately worry that I will move there and be stuck in a place that has a water crisis or horrible heat waves and it’s keeping me from making rational decisions based on my life now. I tried talking to my therapist about it, and she unfortunately missed what I was getting at and just validated that that is something to consider (she hasn’t been a good fit, so probably won’t be going anymore soon).

I really need help finding a balance between knowing that some of this is a reality of the world we are in today but not letting it take away from my well being now. I just can’t seem to find anyone who understands where I’m at with this and I need help navigating it.",Managing climate change anxiety,0
