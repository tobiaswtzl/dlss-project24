&gt;South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas has pulled a major surprise, picking an independent MP to join his new cabinet.  
&gt;  
&gt;The premier on Thursday named Geoff Brock as his local government, regional and veterans' affairs minister.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Brock won the mid-north seat of Stuart in Saturday's election after successfully switching from his electorate of Frome to take on former deputy premier Dan van Holst Pellekaan.  
&gt;  
&gt;The change was prompted by boundary changes which moved many of his supporters from Frome into Stuart.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Brock had previously served as a minister in the Labor administration of former premier Jay Weatherill after he provided support in 2014 for Mr Weatherill to form a minority government.  
&gt;  
&gt;But with Labor likely to hold a clear majority in the next parliament, the new government did not need his support this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Less surprising on Thursday was the appointment of Nick Champion as Trade and Investment Minister.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Champion easily won the northern suburbs seat of Taylor after making the switch from federal parliament, where he had served for almost 15 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other members of the Labor minister were largely predictable, with most taking on the same roles they held on the opposition's front bench.  
&gt;  
&gt;Chris Picton has been named health minister, Stephen Mullighan treasurer, Tom Koutantonis infrastructure and transport minister and Blair Boyer education minister.  
&gt;  
&gt;Deputy Premier Susan Close increased her workload with the portfolios of industry and science, space and defence industries, climate, environment and water.  
&gt;  
&gt;Four of the new ministers, Kyam Maher, Nat Cook, Katrine Hildyard and Andrea Michaels, will need to formally take their oaths at a later date after taking part in the Government House ceremony by video link while in COVID-19 isolation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Labor's cabinet reveal came as counting neared a close after Saturday's poll, with the new government almost certain to hold 27 seats in the 47-seat House of Assembly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Liberals will probably hold 15, with four or possibly five going to independents.  
&gt;  
&gt;Former premier Steven Marshall in Dunstan is still locked in a tight contest with Labor's Cressida O'Hanlon in the eastern suburbs seat of Dunstan.  
&gt;  
&gt;After trailing earlier this week, Mr Marshall has pulled ahead but will need the remaining pre-poll and postal votes to continue favouring him to get across the line.

16,fmg6dtc,"&gt;Could you perhaps give me an example of a concrete policy that would involve this structural change, just so I have a clearer idea of what you mean by this?

Structural changes and baseline political values aren't just one easily summarised thing but the capitalism v socialism dichotomy or the existence of states woupd be the two largest ones. There's also a lot of smaller ones around how say jobs work or public bodies e.g. is the police directly publicly controlled or is it a professional body of the state.

&gt;Okay, so, I want to come back to a point I made in my original post, which is that government spending in most countries takes place within a relatively narrow range. Another way to put this point is that radical libertarianism and radical socialism have both been effectively eliminated as viable policy programmes in established democracies.

This feels very ""end of history"" to me. The idea that liberal democracy is some kind of political apotheosis is naïve at best especially when we are facing one of the largest crises ever as a consequence of our economic structures (climate change). 

It's also very much an argument for what ought to be from what is which is bad reasoning. Just because now is the heydey for a specific idea doesn't by any means make their policies good or optimal. It was once the heydey of monarchies and fedualism and that was clearly awful, restrictive and oppressive. Monarchies did a huge amount of long term economically inefficient things or even short term all to maintain the vested interests of those already with power. 

Those with vested interests inherently limit what is politically achievable and what is politically conceivable. We now live in a world with globalised capital and the free movement of capital which is one of the core vested powers and as such to not feel their ire and to not have them use their political power against you losing your leadership role you cannot fight their interests easily.",,

TL;DR: Read it.  but also... Yes it is happening, but not as bad as shifty folks are trying to portray.  The West can't do much about it without severely sacrificing our industry/economy, which is already tenuous enough where I say climate change (note: this doesn't include things like conservation/not dumping waste into rivers, which I am in full favor of) needs to be on the backburner.


I believe it is happening, but not to the drastic effect that many people attempt to portray it as.  I am hesitant to trust the American left-wing who try to make it seem apocalyptic, and I hope you can see that leaders on the Left have been mighty shifty/scummy recently.  Also, the majority of the studies into the phenomenon are funded or done at universities which are a notorious breeding ground for left-wing ideology.  

Any change we as Western countries make to fix it would have negligible effect on the total contribution, as seen by the Paris Climate Agreement's predicted results.  The majority of damage to the climate is currently coming from China and India, the two most densely-populated places on Earth.  The economies in those areas are improving, and people are starting to purchase more old (Freon) air conditioners, cars, etc.  Environmental (and safety) regulations over there are laughable, which is why you see more and more companies move all their factories there (There's a reason Trump considers China a rival!).  The Paris Agreement would have placed heavy restriction on US industry while not tackling the worst offenders.  If there was some multinational accord that was fair, and didn't just give China and India a slap on the wrist, I might support it.  

Now, none of this applies to conservation, which I believe should be the world's primary focus now.  Teddy Roosevelt was my favorite President because he cared about every aspect of this country, including its natural beauty.  Maintaining our natural resources is crucial to the safety and happiness of not only our environment, but humanity as a whole.  I am firmly for any ways to lower trash impact, reduce landfills, save our waterways, plant more trees, etc.  Hell, I even try to grow some vegetables and herbs so that I am not giving money to those that would destroy forests to expand farms.

The economy in America is great, but it could crash at any moment.  I want to focus on getting us into a better state before we can focus on anything else.  Trump has done well so far, and I trust that in 6 years, once we have a more stable and secure country, maybe we can start taking a look at climate.

ok, let's actually do this lol. here are the two quotes:

ryan:

&gt;This New York thing is being blown out of proportion. What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important. Animals need saving and that’s more important.

grimes:

&gt;I want to make climate change fun. People don’t care about it, because we’re being guilted. I see the polar bear and want to kill myself. No one wants to look at it, you know? I want to make a reason to look at it. I want to make it beautiful.

ryan's quote can be reduced like this:

1. 9/11 was not that bad
2. this other thing (dying whales) is much worse than 9/11
3. therefore, people should stop worrying about 9/11 and worry about whales

grimes's quote can be reduced like this:

1. climate change is important
2. people don't like to think about things that make them feel bad
3. let's increase the visibility of climate change by making the topic fun and beautiful

...

grimes never says climate change isn't bad. she also isn't arguing that something else is worse than it. also ryan is arguing about two things and deciding one is worse than the other, while grimes is just talking about one thing, and thinking about how best to ""brand"" it for success. finally 9/11 was a punctuated trauma while climate change is a slow process with delayed effects, so the emotional contexts in which the quotes were uttered are not remotely equivalent.

in conclusion the quotes aren't the same at all and it's actually really hard to directly compare them since they're so different in structure and intent. this either means the author is so bad at thinking that they believe this is a valid comparison, or they don't care at all about misdirecting their readers in order to smear a celebrity for clicks. either way it makes for a weird and dumb article.

We don't need more progressive votes in California or the NE. We need suburban voters in swing states. There was plenty of evidence in 2018 that more moderate candidates can achieve this.

Well, the rejection of teh *issues* by both Clinton and the people who support her and vote for her, certainly supports the idea that the Democratic Party is not ""progressive,"" at least on those specific issues.

.

And compare Sanders 100% true statement that climate change is teh ost important foreign policy issue we face, with Clinton's elaborate staements about details of dealing with various countries and only 2 minor mentions of climate change embedded in the larger discussion.

There IS no loarger discussion if the average-case put forth by climate scientists is true. The CIA notes that climate change will drive mass migrations of 100s of millions of people that will lead to local wars on a scale that has never been seen before.

And if the worst-case scenariors are true, we lose ALL coastal areas in every country in the world, and the mass migrations will be on the order of multiple BILLIONS of people.

Discussing details while pushing the elephant in the room to the side is NOT being progressive or realistic in any sense of the word, and yet that is how Clinton presents her foreign policy and that is what people who vote for Clinton are in favor of: incremental solutions to the ultimate (this side of a collision with an asteroid) environmental catastrophe.

2. I'm not sure about Republicans at large, but personally I believe that racism and sexism can only truly be addressed through education and time.  Anecdotally, I see much less racism and sexism in the youth of the nation and when they grow up they will raise their children with the same beliefs.  The only alternatives that I have seen proposed are affirmative-actionesque policies, or reprimands.  Both of which are essentially racism in the opposite direction.  I was taught from a young age that, ""two wrongs don't make a right,"" and ""don't fight fire with fire."" Using a racially biased system to correct the problems from the old racially biased system does not seem like an ethical solution.

3. The conservative philosophy, as pointed out several times in this post, is for a smaller government, specifically because government is inefficient. Rather than have tax dollars go towards helping the less fortunate, conservatives believe that charitable giving (both to religious organizations and other charities) is a more effective way of helping those in need.

4. What you view as undermining is most likely the Republican attempts to open more opportunities for other organizations to step in and fill this role.  As I stated earlier, conservatives don't believe that the government is the best choice to solve these problems.

I won't say that I think the current administration or congress is doing a great job at solving any of these issues (or any issues for that matter), but I believe this is an opportunity for organizations, companies, and the local/state governments to make a difference. 

I don't speak for all Republicans, in fact I wouldn't even consider myself one, but it seems to me that the root of the problem here is  the failure for either side to acknowledge that the other's opinion could be valid and rational. I don't expect for others to conform to my point of view, but I do expect that when they tell me my view is invalid they have made an honest attempt to look at it from a different perspective.

Honestly, not according to well over 99.9% of scientists. You can argue that the warming phase we are in isn't caused by humans, but you can't argue it isn't happening. Figuring out how much ice will melt and how much of an effect that will have is trivial these days with satellite imaging. The only way to slow it down would be if there was a huge volcano that put so much ash into the atmosphere that is caused us to lose year after year of crops for a long, long time. That would be even worse.


&gt;Wait... are most cities coastal? Why will more than 50% of cities have to move?


Yes. It's way more than 50% too. There are already small nations that know for a fact that they are going to be completely underwater in a few decades. In some cases a lot less, like the Maldives. They know for a fact they will completely erased within a generation with certainty. There are a lot of interesting plans for how the island nation might be able to survive, but they are not feasible for most places because they are so small.

Many climate change activists justify overstating the impact of climate change by saying it doesn't matter.

Anyway, the Gaia Hypothesis is a half-century-old scientific theory from the renowned climate researchers James Lovelock and  Lynn Margulis (both prominent in their fields, respectively chemistry and microbiology).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia\_hypothesis

That the Earth is a self-regulating biome that works with a multifaceted biological intelligence is less a new idea than science catching up -- in the 1960s/1970s -- to the reality of large biological systems. Margulis' work in particular scaled up from her speciality, microbiology, just as modern science was beginning to comprehend the complex web of biological societies within larger animals. 

Shocks to the system such as extinction events -- asteroid crashes, rapid climate change, etc. -- upsets these systems, which work on a longer time scale than the changes wrought by catastrophes. Still, the inherent intelligence of the Earth biome eventually corrects and adjusts to the externally-caused reality. Although that can be, as in the famous case of the dinosaurs, the end of most forms of dominant animal life.

&gt;I don't think reparations are **effective policy**,

Effective Policy are fundamental changes in the structure of our government that can get the support to be passed into law.  The fundamental changes I advocate for are ones that empower the black community to better their own positions, which would help change the political climate and possibly make reparations feasible (in terms of supporting votes). In other words, instead of thinking of these things as ""either/or,""  I'd think of them as ""Step 1, Step 2, etc.""  How would you place these steps in order to most effectively help immediately, and help further change?  


I also feel like you ignored this sentence:

Ok?  Isn't that the problem?  America isn't ""Equal""?

&gt;well basically whenever i do something wrong like wake him up in the morning on accident, he starts screaming at me and telling me to shut up and that i’m stupid, but when i get angry the SLIGHTEST like saying that he shouldn’t be angry all the time, he gets even more angry, and i honestly want to punch him in the face

I have no idea what you mean by  waking him up in the morning on accident, but I'll assume whatever I want. Okay, if someone acts like they're clean and dry, they're probably clean and dry. You're in a conflict, he views his anger as his instrument for winning, and if he thinks you threaten to take that away, he thinks it's a threat. This is the same reason why supporters of war use the traitorous critic fallacy a lot. He's not playing to agree with you, he's trying to win. You're in a lose-lose situation that he thinks is a win- lose situation. He thinks that anything anyone says other than to be unkind to you is blaming him for whatever he says or thinks is happening. Such conflicts are very vain. To win conflicts like this and stay in something, you need to recruit allies and look good before them. You can't reason with such people, there's nothing that can ever u***** your relationship with him, and the situation needs to change, and the only way that can ever happen is if there are no people there. The situation perpetuates Itself by making people losers that are too pathetic and scared to leave. The situation is a climate of b******* emotions, such as fear of being alone or ignored. He's not your job, you're not even supposed to be in the region. He's not there to accept help from you, and you are not there to help him. He's not there to help you, and you're not there to accept help from him. They might offer you material gain, power, matchmaking services, or attention, but none of it is ever worth it and none of it is ever likely to survive this situation. The situation will likely perish soon, and when it does, all therein will meet some sort of unkind and pointless fate. You're in a dysfunctional home, and prison is another dysfunctional home where people that started out in such homes wind up. Therefore, being from that home is a crime, and being there any longer is an extenuating factor in this offense. You're not learning anything interesting there, and this is absolutely terrible for your physical health. If there is such a thing as mental illness, this kind of domestic absurdity is a leading cause of why there is such a thing. The police can't help you, they're based on going over there and attacking someone to try to earn the badass cred they want. Domestic disputes are contemptible and weak, so policing doesn't really apply to it. The presence of assholes like your father in the region means that the region has a sick, contemptible, and weak culture.

Power sides with what passes for your father's power. Every Enterprise is based on money, power, and sometimes attention, including the social worker's office, and above all the police. Social workers offices and police organizations have different rationales. The rationale of the social worker's office is for the government to make concessions out of realpolitik, and if they're intrinsically motivated, there's some trust and sympathy too. If they don't trust you, they will call the police. Police attention is something that happens to people like us a lot. The police are motivated by vanity and are motivated by fear of being alone or ignored, that's why they have buildings full of people that can't leave, and it's why they use force and interrogations to get people in there, because it gets attention. The police want to be seen as badass, and they have to earn it by going around looking for a fight and for people they can bring in and interrogate and find a way to make them look guilty of something, so that they don't have to be alone or ignored ever again. Criminals fall for it because they want to be made to pay for their offenses by being locked up, because criminals have the exact same motivations, plus a lot of them want to be in prison to get more access to contraband. Domestic disputes are contemptible and weak, and the police know that their enemies perceive it that way, and that their fans don't see it as badass. However, the police might respond to a domestic dispute, and when a child is a party to that dispute, police are rigged against the kid.

Never talk with your father,  and since you are likely to do so,  pick up safe topics that you can't use against you. Never tell him anything important comment secret, nor personal. Never try to reason with him. Be silent when anyone confronts you, especially him. All of that is why you need to leave into something that isn't prison, and why the police won't help you. You need the trust of social workers. That's why, never tell a social worker that they don't get it, or that they don't feel that way. Never bring up the concept of ""any means necessary"" with a social worker.

To leave, you may have to make a lot of sacrifices and difficult decisions. I used to be a cute kid, and now I'm a loser, and maybe even a sociopath. Maybe I can do a menial job, but I'll never be able to f*** properly. It's all because I failed to get out fast enough. Advisors don't really like to appeal to fear and make ultimatums a lot, but the unstated assumption when someone uses a shift response when giving advice is follow the adviser's instructions now or else this will happen to you too. So just leave now even if you're not 18 yet. You probably won't be allowed to leave, so smuggle your journal into a social worker's office until the police allow you to leave or you're 18 years old. If anyone finds out about the journal, it's gone. Start adulting immediately. Do not care very much how people perceive you, since you're trying to leave, perception is not as valuable as if you were fighting to stay. Run if you're able, and if you're not, doing and flinching walk away from his explosion. In any case, don't get caught leaving, and if you do get caught leaving, leave anyway.

Climate change. The optimal way of limiting emissions is to make small and dense cities. Someone who believe in climate change and who want to act upon it should move to a dense city.

Believing in survivalism. The optimal strategy in that case is to move far from civilization in a place where you can grow your own food.

Believing that the USA was better under the rule of England. A lot of people moved when the USA became independent.

My personal encounters with family, coworkers, acquaintances who refuse to wear a mask or only partially cover their faces have been entirely motivated by political misinformation. 

I think judging someone walking through IKEA and touching merchandise with their mask on their chin and a MAGA hat proudly displayed as an asshole is entirely appropriate. I think if a coworker refuses to wear a mask because they say they won't be able to breathe, when they have never had lung problems or anxiety problems in the past and that same person spouts climate change denial every day or claims that mask mandates are just anti-Trump propaganda, that coworker is an asshole. I think that if a politician walks up to the podium with a mask on, rips it off, and yells ""I can't breathe!"" into the microphone, that person is an asshole.

Animal agriculture is immoral.

You are not morally responsible for things you have no influence over.

My purchasing decisions have little to no impact on other people's large-scale purchasing decisions.

A few years back, before committing to my current job, I wanted to have *the big journey* and I always wanted an off-the-grid experience. Something where I couldn't be found even if someone came searching for me. At the time I had finished the first *Life is Strange* in the somewhat recent past and the feeling of Max's &amp; Chloe's story and the northern west coast never left me. I'm also a cold climate kind of guy, so I decided on British Columbia in Canada, packed my buddy and booked a there and back ticket with two months in between that were absolutely completely empty.

We landed and had only given ourselfves a few days of leeway in a hostel before we'd had to find *something*. From then on we went with friendly people, camped on random camping sites, looked for hosts with work somewhere in the state, riding greyhound busses and slowly crept towards the Rockies where we ended up just in time for autumn.

I didn't find *Life is Strange*'s Arcadia Bay, but Stardew Valley of all things. Of all the things I was and wasn't expecting, this still flabbergasts me to this day. The déjà vu on that tiny island somewhere north at Vancouver Island was unreal, my time there is certainly among the most treasured memories I have. It was only two weeks, but we somehow ended up knowing every person there and probably visited half the living rooms and lawns exchanging stories and drinking homemade brews and teas.

Oh that was quite the rambling, haha. I had some expectation as to how I could change and grow, but I couldn't anticipate just how much I ended up changing, this kind of journey really opens up a part of yourself that you'd never see anyway else.

197,haj01ve,"I’m still waiting on these doomsday’s to come true espoused by the environmental movement. Previous predictions and causes include. A) world famine and mass death due to overpopulation. B) The fear of nuclear radiation leak from power plants ending in absolute annihilation. C) the melting of the ozone layer causing cancers and deformed babies and a heating of the surface of the earth. D) climate uncontrollable warming due to CO2 emissions. 

Now. Climate change. The uncertainty’s and questions. Questions. 

A) the earths climate goes thru heating and cooling trends constantly. The earths climate changes over thousands or millions of years. Well documented in geology. The earth recently. (Considering we are talking always. Earths time. Not human lifespan). Has gone thru an ice age. Then a warming trend into the current period. Before modern humans existed. And during zero human CO2 emissions. So. Is the current warming of the earth (which is not warming everywhere but is causing ice cap erosion and ocean warming) due to human activity. And is CO2 emissions the main cause or even an accelerant?  This is still an open question. However. I do not deny it may have human contribution. Nor do I deny human pollution and carbon is probably a bad footprint. Lol. 

B). If the climate does warm. Will this cause disaster for the globe or humanity. This is not known. If the change is gradual. Like thousands of years or millions as it has been before there’s a lot that can be speculated. Will it continue till earth is a fireball? Lol. Doomsday. Or will it slow? Or will humans even be using carbon tech in 2000 years?

C). Even if we suppose. The climate is warming due to human activity and carbon emissions. ( not certain proved fact of science but a developing theory ). Then why do you suppose government is the solution to this problem?  Does government usually cause human tech to advance. It isn’t that the creative power of economics and a free exchange of ideas that causes this?  Do you suppose that a governor or president has an answer for the problem?  And even if the United States bans carbon emissions. Modern economies run on carbon. It’s just how it is. It’s a cheap resource that has proven cost effective and reliable for the production and transport of most goods and services. The economic destruction caused in the west. Mass starvation. Economic ruin. May not even help the CO2 earth emissions. China and developing countries are much dirtier running. Have fewer options. Since producing power from sources other than carbon is not yet cost effective. 

D). If the earth is warming due to CO2. The only way to create a solution to it would be a cheap energy source that produces no pollution. So far. That’s a thought dream not yet discovered. Electric cars use electricity. That create that power thru carbon or nuclear. Both which environmentalists scorn. Solar power is expensive unreliable and produces little by comparison. Wind is an absolute joke. So. As of now. We need an inventor or great scientist to find some new secret not yet unleashed. 

E). The discovery of future tech regarding energy may actually be stymied by an economic meltdown due to abandoning carbon fuel. No investors in new tech. No wealth to waste on experimentation. Also. If government is put in charge they may pay friends contracts for solar. But deny a new tech any funding because … politicians don’t understand these things like an engineer or scientist. 

Also. Climate change fits very neatly into the left wing rhetoric regarding “greedy corporations poison us”. So. It’s suspicious without proof. And because it’s become political it is not interested in truth. But coalition building. Political power. Winning elections. Getting funding. That stuff has little to do with science or truth empirically speaking. 

So. There’s a lot of questions and some bad motivation problems in the whole climate change debate that makes any conclusion harder to come to than. “We gotta save the planet, pass a law!!”

Also. In suggestion. If your going to solve climate change. You need to be Einstein. Not a voter wanting the government to gift it to you. Lol. But. Honestly. The world runs on energy. Carbon is the energy source that is cost effective produces energy and is understood and created. If you wanna stop CO2 emissions. You need to be a scientist and engineer who makes a discovery.

This article is another long one so I'd recommend a full read through as the following paragraphs are just some key points I personally got out of the article and what I think serves as a decent summary of it. 

&gt; Nations around the world are pledging to plant billions of trees to grow new forests. But a new study shows that the potential for natural forest regrowth to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and fight climate change is far greater than has previously been estimated.

&gt; Cook-Patton’s new study, published in Nature and co-authored by researchers from 17 academic and environmental organizations, says estimates of the rate of carbon accumulation by natural forest regrowth, endorsed last year by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are on average 32 percent too low, a figures that rises to 53 percent for tropical forests.

&gt; The study is the most detailed attempt yet to map where forests could grow back naturally, and to assess the potential of those forests to accumulate carbon. “We looked at almost 11,000 measurements of carbon uptake from regrowing forests, measured in around 250 studies around the world,” Cook-Patton told Yale Environment 360.

&gt; Another study published this year found that such recovery was widespread and rapid even in an epicenter of deforestation such as the Amazon. When Yunxia Wang of the University of Leeds in England analyzed recently-released Brazilian data from the Amazon, she found that 72 percent of the forest being burned by ranchers to create new cattle pasture is not pristine forest, as widely assumed, but is actually recent regrowth. The forest had been cleared, converted to cattle pasture and then abandoned, whereupon the forest returned so fast that it was typically only six years before it was cleared again. Such was the confusion caused by this rapid forest turnover that regular land-use assessments frequently wrongly categorized this new growth as degraded old-growth forest.

&gt; Much the same has been happening in Europe, where forest cover is now up to 43 percent, often from naturally recolonizing farmland rather than planting. Italy, for instance, has grown its forest cover by a 2.5 million acres. In the former Communist nations of central Europe, 16 percent of farmland in the Carpathian Mountains was abandoned in the 1990s, much of it reclaimed by the region’s famed beech forests. Across Russia, an area of former farmland about twice the size of Spain has been recolonized by forests. Irina Kurganova of the Russian Academy of Sciences calls this retreat of the plow “the most widespread and abrupt land-use change in the 20th century in the Northern Hemisphere.”

Not only did it halt the spread of the revolution into the heart of the Imperialist core, it also doomed the Soviet Union into having to take a militaristic seige mindset just to survive. A mindset that they never recovered from and that ultimately doomed them. 

Relatedly, the collapse of the Soviet Union is probably a strong second. I'm not the biggest fan of what the Soviet Union became, but the failure of the original revolution was a harsh blow. While the USSR existed there was at least a debate on the merit of socialism, afterwards the refrain of ""there is no alternative"" was bashed into the public consciousness with a mallet and now it overshadows all conversations on how we organize our society. Can't even talk about health care or climate change without ""socialism failed"" being used to shut down any attempts at reform.

The western interventions and atrocities against leftist movements in the developing world are definitely bad, but had the German revolution succeeded they might never have happened.",,
221,i2m035a,"I sold home insurance for them for years. They’ve actually tracked rebuild cost every year. However, your rebuild cost/bill only ACTUALLY changes under two circumstances

1. At renewal. You’ll get a notification of the new rebuild cost in the paperwork ~60-90 days before

2. If you make a policy change that involves you recalculating coverages or updating home characteristics

A great way to understand rebuild/replacement costs is to ignore sales prices and think of the extreme examples

I once sold a policy for a very basic ~1k square foot home in San Francisco. The member paid in excess of $1,000,000 for the home but the rebuild calculated less than half of that. 

They threw a fit until i explained - if your house were to burn down tomorrow, it would not cost $1,000,000 to actually repair, that sales price has school districts, desirability, job market, public transport, climate, etc all baked into it

But at the end of the day, it’s still only a 1k square foot house. Sure, CA permitting and labor would be higher than most other states, but certainly not to justify running up the rebuild cost more than 100%

The opposite applies - home insurance for century old homes in rural areas often times has very high rebuild costs. The purchase price might not be that high, especially if it’s in a not as desirable area, but older homes rarely use modern, cheap, construction techniques and often require specialized labor and materials to match

Yes, running down the mainstream media helps to convince people that evidence, research, etc are less important than opinion pieces which reinforce your own biases. This helps to drive the anti-science nutcases who reject climate change, and the gun fanatics who are convinced that many of the mass shootings across the USA are just false flag operations intended to impose gun control, and a raft of other conspiracy theories.

The difficulty is that mainstream media has increasingly been consolidated under fewer and fewer owners, so that currently 90% of MSM (radio, tv, movies, newspapers, magazines) are owned by only 6 corporations, 2 of which are controlled by the same family. That isn't providing the range of views needed by a healthy democracy, instead it maintains a primarily corporate focus on articles and production, focused on the bottom line and profitability at the expense of originality, objectivity, and journalistic integrity.

Hence MSM very rarely reports on anything that shows the USA in a bad light, it regularly runs nationalistic puff pieces showing ""USA #1!!"", and rarely covers the way that corporate and personal greed is making wealth inequality much worse while also destroying any chance of a real democracy driven by an informed citizenry.

US MSM were a primary enabler of the Iraq war, even when the evidence was overwhelming that Bush &amp; Cheney's ""justifications""  for that invasion were 100% fabricated, they have rarely ever called for America's leaders to be held accountable for their many  war crimes, they have rarely ever criticized the US policy of imperialism, nor its means of implementing those policies by brute force.

So Yes, attacks on the media are helping drive the anti-science movement of ignorance and complacency, but media consolidation and a corporate media focus is the cause of so much of the distrust   behind those attacks.

If those corporate media giants were broken up into separate and competing companies, and tighter controls placed upon further consolidation, real news might again flourish, and trust in media might start to return.",,

Not so much to people directly, but on addressing fundamental structural issues such as infrastructure, social work, education, disability funding, social safety nets. 

I can give you an example. In my country I work for a funding scheme which allows participant funds to be allocated to services such as occupational therapy, physio therapy etc. these funds can increase the participants capacity to function in society, acquire work, and repay the contribution to the economy. I’ve seen this play out in real life. 

Raise the federal minimum wage too. The argument of “inflation” concerns is utter bullshit considering how long it has been since a minimum wage rise. The rise should be more closely indexed to inflation in order to maintain standards of living. We are talking about an extremely small proportion of money in the economy

There are flow on benefits too such as increased business and consumer participation. Money will actually be going to businesses rather than sucked up by basic cost of living elements such as rent

A lot of people think it's about technology, but it's really about the type of issues faced by a generation and their reaction to those issues.

For post-Gen-Zers, the struggle is that they are suffering the unintended political consequences of free-market capitalism. That is to say, the rise of nationalism and the pursuit of national self-sufficiency. Simultaneously however, these Post-Gen-Zers are absorbed by technology which presents this information to them on a grand scale meaning we are desensitized (an issue that Gen Z has as well). Their lives will be filled with crises that seemingly never affect them until it becomes very bad (pandemics, climate change, natural disasters etc.).

Gen-Z on the other hand, our struggle has and always will be in our name. We are seeing the beginning of the crises which will bring humanity to either relative utopia or dystopia, and it's why I don't like the name 'Gen Alpha'.

245,huspsnw,"&gt;The German response to WWII has been one of the best lessons on how to deal with the fact that one's nation has done horrible things.

It hasn't always been like that though. The upcoming Cold War caused the Western Allies as well as the Soviets to lose their interest in hunting down former Nazis quite rapidly. ""De-Nazification"" trials mostly turned into a farce as early as 1946, with many perpetrators being put on trial and aquitted away from public - with some even being recruited to help shaping the new German state right away. Especially in West Germany the newly elected Federal government issued a law offering general amnesty to all former Nazis who hadn't been sentenced yet as early as 1951 - with the Western Allies turning pending executions into lifetime prison sentences the same year out of respect for the new German constitution that outlawed the death penalty.

This allowed the generation of immediate perpetrators to hush up and bury the details of their crimes. Sure, German students did learn about Hitler, the Nazis and WW2 - but never in such great detail they were to truly understand the full extend of what their parents and grandparents had allowed to happen - or played an active part in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Cast a dirty great spotlight on it, examine it in detail and put measures in place to ensure it never happens again.

It took until the Social upheavals of the late 60s and 70s to change the political climate and allow for a more open confrontation of former Nazis and the culture of silence they established. The period of Social-Democratic led federal and state governments throughout the 70s into the 1980s also helped breaking up these structures but the way it's dealt with today wasn't widely established before the Wehrmacht-exhibition (which was supposed to clean up the myth of the German army being mostly uninvolved with Nazi crimes).

It's a constant uphill battle to maintain this culture too, btw. There are far-right politicians who would like to replace our culture of rememberance with a more ""patriotic"" approach. They remain suspiciously silent on the details but their slogans usually involve stuff like ""time to end the guilt-cult"" or ""for a Germany worthy of pride"" - so, never take this for granted.

As many surviving Holocaust victims left Germany for understandable reasons this wasn't as much of an issue.

You have to do that without tearing your country apart - which to be fair is quite a daunting task.

For me when I think about the problem of climate change, that’s the ozone layer problem that became a big issue in the 80s (I’m not double-checking specific facts that aren’t pertinent to this CMV, sorry if I mess a fact up, hopefully it’s not critical to my overall proposal). All the major countries who have money to lose by finding more expensive ways to do fundamental things like refrigeration actually solved the problem, and it took decades and pretty weak pacts (called the “Montreal Protocol”). It somehow worked, in a complicated way I’d have to spend years of my finite life studying.

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/ozone-action-worked-environmental-progress/

I don’t know how we’ll deal with the more complex and complicated issue of climate change for example, that requires such levels of working together across the globe and technology and economics beyond the ozone hole problem (and recent news shows there may be some previously-unknown chemicals that may still be affecting the ozone layer we’ll have to address), but I thought that way before the ozone hole problem, and was proven wrong. So that’s how the past can help support the argument that the continuous improvement of the past leads to hope to the future. 

End of point, but some implications I’d like your’s/anyone’s thoughts on:

If anything, it helps me focus on what actually drives that “past continuous improvement = future success in all problems” line that people (wrongfully) hold as gospel. It’s not gospel, we could all succumb to tribalism/nationalism in an unhealthy way and not solve climate change for example. It can likely only be solved by working together, since these types of problems are by nature beyond one individual or group of individuals, and historical examples of that are what prove that it’s possible even if I as an individual do nothing. 

That gets to why people hold that line as gospel, because it makes them feel better about not doing enough and that’s the scissors where rational thought is paper for the human brain, but the concept I lay out here shows that irrational thought feels better than considering the rational alternative until it doesn’t (per your home foreclosure example). It does take people working together to solve issues that aren’t easily solved by looking at the past, because we need new ideas and mindsets. I’m guilty of this irrational thought as well, for example I don’t do enough for poverty (though my career is tackling one small part of climate change, cleaner energy), but my own internal cost/benefit analysis today is that I pay taxes and try to get a government (just another group of people) to solve the issues I have to choose not to spend years of my life learning about to address.

""Unclear"" isn't the same as ""not happening"", and as a layperson, I'd actually agree that while there's widespread consensus that climate change is *happening*, what it's going to do, exactly, remains pretty ""unclear"".",,
255,d73s37q,"Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I've read (from scientists that recognize climate change) that the total amount the seas will rise is a bit misleading. The water doesn't raise uniformly on our planet--I think it had to do with magnetic forces. For instance, if we melt a certain portion of the antarctic ice cap and the sea level will raise 1 meter, that isn't 1 meter worldwide. It could be 2 meters in some places and 1 cm in another part of the world. Some places will be harder hit than others, while others that are at or slightly above sea level will actually not be affected that much.

PS: I feel like I need to affirm that I 100% recognize climate change and the need to do something about it--also that it might be too late.",,
256,fuwinx7,"of course they didn't like those actions. here are the reasons why:

increased tariffs benefit only benefit the government, if anybody. exporters see decreased demand because they have to offset the importation cost to consumers

pulling out of climate agreements. trump receives campaign donations from oil/gas, and he wants to pander to the antiintellectual crowd so of course this was financially and politically motivated. climate change is happening as a result of fossil fuel combustion and anybody who doesn't believe that is eating up propaganda from the oil/gas industry

building a border wall. a symbolically negative gesture that retraces from the original concept of america being a ""melting pot"" that accepted people from all walks of life. maybe this goes hand in hand with his ""shithole countries"" comments

allowing fewer immigrants highlights my previous point quite well, and it's a shame to see the downturn in opportunity for international citizens looking to move to the US

Sorry, humans don't work that way. I completely agree though BTW. There is not too much difference with offering jobs at a living wage and a basic income. The idea just needs some slight adjustments. Why not accept that?

Getting to a useful Job Guarantee is going to be difficult enough - ensuring, as it must, that everybody is doing something they enjoy and that others see as valuable, as well as informing the general public constantly of that value in each local area. Broadening the concept of what work is and means is the main challenge. In fact in some countries it may be impossible until unemployment gets to depression levels, probably beyond that towards societal breakdown. Humans like to push things to the very edge before making a course alteration - as we're seeing with the response to Climate Change.

Ultimately BIG people tend to be interested in abolishing a quite narrow idea of 'work' as a matter of basic philosophy. It's a core value to them. They are a very small minority of people that like the idea of not having to do anything for a living and being 'free' - even though that freedom isn't really extended to those that will have to continue to work to keep the lights on, and who would have to pay a much higher tax rate for the privilege.",,

Basically, unless changes are made, the earth may warm by 1.5°C/2.7°F above pre-industrial climate, somewhere between 2030 and 2052 . It is important to remember this includes the current increase over pre-industrial climate of somewhere in the range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C.

Here's a 2013 [cite](http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988313002028). See also the landmark [2017 industry report](https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/IMG/pdf/20170912wnisr2017-en-lr.pdf#Report%202017%20V5.indd%3A.30224%3A7746). This is the foreword:


&gt; 
&gt; Nuclear power was born in a sea of euphoria out of a collective American guilt over dropping
&gt; the atomic bomb. And for at least two decades it was the “clean” alternative to coal that was
&gt; going to meet all of our energy needs forever.
&gt; 
&gt; The Three Mile Island meltdown, in 1979, ended the euphoria but the dream continued and it
&gt; still goes on without much regard to contrary facts.
&gt; 
&gt; The opponents of nuclear power have shown a similar disregard for changing facts. They largely
&gt; ignored the fact that many well-meaning people viewed local air pollution and climate
&gt; change more of a danger than nuclear. In those years shutting down a nuclear plant did mean
&gt; increased emissions of local pollutants and green house gases.
&gt; 
&gt; The debate about nuclear power was similar to talking about a religion. It was seldom grounded
&gt; in all the relevant facts- each side had a religious belief in their point of view boosted by
&gt; whatever ad hoc facts supported their view.
&gt; 
&gt; Because of that history, this 2017 World Nuclear Industry Status Report is perhaps the most decisive
&gt; document in the history of nuclear power. The report makes clear, in telling detail, that
&gt; the debate is over. Nuclear power has been eclipsed by the sun and the wind. These renewable,
&gt; free-fuel sources are no longer a dream or a projection-they are a reality that are replacing
&gt; nuclear as the preferred choice for new power plants worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; It no longer matters whether your greatest concern is nuclear power or climate change the
&gt; answer is the same. The modern-day “Edisons” have learned to harness economically the everlasting
&gt; sources of energy delivered to earth by Mother Nature free of charge.
&gt; 
&gt; The value of this report is that this conclusion no longer relies on hope or opinion but is what is
&gt; actually happening. In country after country the facts are the same. Nuclear power is far from
&gt; dead but it is in decline and renewable energy is growing by leaps and bounds.
&gt; 
&gt; The entire Report is must be read so that the facts of nuclear decline in the U.S., Germany,
&gt; Japan, and France –indeed just about every country- really sinks in. It is more than symbolic
&gt; that the Japanese Government has formally accepted the death of its breeder reactor, which
&gt; was the original holy-grail of nuclear power.
&gt; 
&gt; **Most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world, where there is a competitive market for
&gt; electricity, has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated.** Only where the government
&gt; or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered.
&gt; The most decisive part of this report is the final section- Nuclear Power vs Renewable Energy
&gt; Development. It reveals that since 1997, worldwide, renewable energy has produced four times
&gt; as many new kilowatt-hours of electricity than nuclear power.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the Revolution has not been televised, but it is well underway. Renewable energy is a
&gt; lower cost and cleaner, safer alternative to fossil fuels than nuclear power.
&gt; The world no longer needs to build nuclear power plants to avoid climate change and certainly
&gt; not to save money. If you have any doubt about that fact please read the World Nuclear Industry
&gt; Status Report 2017.

I'm not going to debate you but part of the problem is that climate change can mean a lot of things with varying degrees of seriousness and urgency.  Obviously, these considerations would have to go into determining the appropriate response.  

Pragmatically, I don't think a tax is the way to go.  It will hurt the poor and encourages government corruption.  The government can always find a way to support a tax.  If we take your asteroid example as indicative of how serious a response should be- then banning the sale of fossil fuels would probably be justifiable- since peron x burning fuels would directly kill person y.

We just need to embrace that rationalism and selflessness should be the basis for our society.

We’re a rational and intelligent species when we want to be. If we stopped thinking for our own individual greed and bias for one moment, then we could maybe build a glorious global community that could tackle these threats?

$555 billion to fight climate change, largely through tax incentives for low-emission sources of energy.

$400 billion to provide universal prekindergarten to 3- and 4-year-olds, and to significantly reduce health care costs for working families earning up to $300,000 a year.

$200 billion to extend an expanded tax credit for parents through 2022, and to permanently allow parents to benefit from the child tax credit even if they do not earn enough money to have income tax liability.

$165 billion to reduce health care premiums for people who are covered through the Affordable Care Act, to provide insurance for an additional four million people through Medicaid and to offer hearing coverage through Medicare.

$150 billion to reduce a waiting list for in-home care for seniors and disabled Americans, and to improve wages for home health care workers.

$150 billion to build one million affordable housing units.

$100 billion for immigration streamlining, in part to reduce a backlog of nine million visas. House Democrats proposed provisions last month to address the legal immigration system, including a plan to recapture hundreds of thousands of unused visas various administrations failed to use over several decades. The investment outlined on Thursday would also expand legal representation for migrants and streamline processing at the southwest border, officials said. Mr. Biden has faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for his handling of migration to the border.

$40 billion for worker training and higher education, including increasing annual Pell grants by $550.

Offsetting that spending is an estimated $2 trillion in revenue increases, including:

A 15 percent minimum tax on the reported profits of large corporations.

Efforts to reduce profit-shifting by multinational companies, including a separate 15 percent minimum tax on profits earned by U.S. companies abroad — and tax penalties for companies that have their headquarters in global tax havens.

A 1 percent tax on corporate stock buybacks.

Increased enforcement for large corporations and the wealthy at the Internal Revenue Service.

An additional 5 percent tax on incomes exceeding $10 million a year and another 3 percent tax on incomes above $25 million.

&gt;“The noise of the propeller and the engine emits at a frequency that can mask the communication of the whales,” she said. “And the overall traffic combines to create sort of a din … so it reduces the actual space over which the whale can hear and be heard by other whales.”

&gt;Climate change has steadily diminished the availability of Chinook salmon, the whales’ main food source. Drone research has revealed whales with altered body shapes and lacking fat deposits, suggesting they are starving. “You can visibly actually see the ribs on some of these whales,” said MacDuffee.

Prior to watching this episode, upon what evidence were your doubts founded?

I mean no mean no avarice nor admonition.  I do not mean to purport any political agenda. I truly do not understand how an informed, intelligent person could ever fail to see mankind's effect on climate. Did you not understand the data presented? Were you convinced by misinformation?

369,ddxmf16,"It's ambiguous. One of those things that people make assumptions about in their own heads without ever checking to see if everyone is on the same page. I've met omnivores who asked me if ""ethical"" meant I didn't eat meat for religious reasons.

The fact of the matter is that environmental concerns are a subset of ethical concerns, as are concerns of animals suffering. There are even strong humanitarian and social arguments for going vegan, which also fall under the category of ethical concerns.

Also, calling animal sentience an ""ethical concern"", without admitting the same for all the other reasons, does sort of convey a sense of arbitrariness (or perhaps lack of rationality) about the subject. Some of us do push back on the notion that concerns involving animals are somehow ""much more arbitrary"" than environmental concerns. Both concerns can be understood from ethical **and** scientific perspectives. IMO, when animal sentience is left on it's own in the ""ethical"" bin in discussions, people are liable to forget this in their quest to categorize vegans as ""rational"" (i.e., environmental) or ""irrational/crazy/activist"" (i.e., ""ethical"").

The science is very clear on climate change. However, science is based on making the best judgements possible given the current information, risks, and benefits. In cognitive science, the best information suggests that non-human animals are suffering for the sake of human luxury and cultural norms. IMO, it is irrational to ignore this simply because one enjoys the taste of meat. The truly rational response is to evaluate the currently available evidence, ask oneself what this says regardless of what ""feels comfortable"". When I did this, I realized my reasons for eating meat had to have been either inconsistent with the assumptions underlying human rights (e.g., it is wrong to cause grave suffering for hedonistic reasons), or inconsistent with the current evidence (e.g., non-human animals most likely suffer greatly in farms &amp; slaughterhouses). I was unwilling to ignore or change the other two, so I quit eating meat instead.",,

Teaching physics doesn't really make you an expert on the energy industry. Myself, I studied electrical engineering and now work in the field doing inspections mainly focusing on nuclear and hydro generating plants around the world. I also don't claim to be an expert on anything outside of my job. I have an opinion on matters and have some inside knowledge of the energy industry but I'm no expert.

&gt;he would start planning something to replace this lost capacity

Lost capacity can easily be picked up by other sectors. For some reason you're using the worst sector in gas saying that it's going to pick up most of the lost energy. It's not. Hydro for example is currently only at 60% capacity during high demand at the moment. Wind turbines even though I think they're overrated can also easily be activated to pick up some of the remaining gaps. You're acting as if we're just going to fire up a bunch of old diesel generators.

&gt;if Doug gave a shit about climate change, he would start planning something to replace this lost capacity.

- My favourite one, Greta's movement seeks to make climate change.... **a gendered issue** 

Yes you read that right, climate change affected *women more than men* so we need to try for laws which protect women. Total bullshit.

- Pave the way for reparations to be paid to countries affected by other countries pollution. Sounds reasonable right? One country polluting the fuck out of another country should be recompensed for it right? 

That would work if there weren't PRIVATE FUCKING COMPANIES. How do you make countries pay reparations for a private companies actions in another country (under the laws of that country?!) It's fucking insanity! 

""you obeyed the pollution laws of this country, but this girl and her parents said you polluted it too much so the country where the company was created should pay reparations.""


I read this years ago when people were busy arguing over the idiot girl saying ""how dare you"" (I don't know how people thought that was powerful, she's an anti-science, misandristic figurehead.)

in conclusion. Greta Thunberg is a useful pawn for her fucking idiot parents to swindle a ton of money out of well-meaning idiots who didn't even read what she wanted to accomplish.

If you plan to play outdoors, you should add appropriate footwear with ankle support to your list, and switch the linked BBs for biodegradable ammunition. You should wear clothing you already own appropriate for strenuous exercise in your climate.

Your first airsoft gun is the most important purchase you will make in airsoft. As your only weapon it must be **versatile**, **reliable**, **affordable**, reasonably high-performance, easy to work on, and compatible with as many accessories and upgrades as possible. This means buying an AEG assault rifle or SMG; **forget about sniper rifles, pistols, GBBs and other restrictive exotica** until you have more money, more experience, and at least one backup weapon.

This loadout is intended solely as an example and is only one way to construct a beginner's loadout. It is based around the AR platform because although airsoft AKs are typically better value for money than airsoft ARs, ARs remain extremely popular and common in airsoft. The G&amp;G CM16 used as a primary weapon here has plastic receivers and mostly plastic external components. CYMA's VFC-clone AKs (the basis of the beginner loadout) have stamped steel receivers and metal external components. They are similarly rugged, but feel heavier and more realistic. If you want to change the primary weapon, bear in mind that you'll need to change most other things in the loadout. Other primary weapons we would recommend as part of a beginner's loadout include:

* G&amp;G's Combat Machine ARs, all of which are roughly equivalent. You can exchange the CM16 in the loadout below with any Combat Machine AR without needing to change anything else (with the possible exception of the battery).
* CYMA's CM040x, CM045x, CM048x and CM050x AKs, all of which are roughly equivalent. For more information, reply 'airsoftbot beginner loadout'.
* APS' UAR V2.

382,cm66sbc,"You misinterpret the danger of perturbations.  The fluctuations that you see in that graph are a result of Milankovitch Cycles.  They happen over 100,000 years, and if you'll look more closely at that graph, you'll see that we should be slowly entering a fairly stable regime, followed by a long and slow uptick in temperatures.  This is why the last 10,000 years is important.  We evolved over the last 3ish million, and our agriculture is suited to the climate of the last 10,000.  If we're suddenly injecting an unprecedented variable into the equation, we're forcing global climate *out* of that long, slow cycle and into territory where we really don't know what to predict.  Not to mention the fact that when ecosystems change slowly over 50,000 years, they have a chance for natural selection to respond in kind.  When the same temperature fluctuation happens over a 200 year period, nothing has the time to respond, and mass extinctions are to be expected.  It's not that climate change is impossible over the course of the planet's history.  It's that it's happening much too fast right now, we're the primary drivers, and very bright scientists see this unfolding very badly for us.

Add to that the fact that your point about carbon following temperature is actually *more* dangerous for us, not less.  If we're seeing temperature trend inversions *independent* of the natural forcing, then we're doing it in *addition* to the natural system, and this is potentially very dangerous.

Not to mention the fact that your last point is faulty.  If it only took 100 years to upend a Milankovitch Cycle and send us into a temperature spike, then why exactly is it unreasonable to expect that a 100-year concerted effort to favor low-carbon technology could produce results in a similar time frame?",,

Why, in the face of all available evidence and despite apparent public consensus to the contrary, would a person believe that the moon landings were faked? 

**Are we entering a golden age of the conspiracy theory?**

‘Post-truth’ society provides the perfect conditions for dubious theories to flourish. But are some people more susceptible to conspiracy theories?

&gt;“I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phoney, fake. A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people …”

[Donald Trump’s assault](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/feb/24/cpac-2017-live-news-day-two-donald-trump?page=with:block-58b04f8ae4b030b6f7c8ebed) on “terrible, dishonest” journalists (“the lowest form of life”) has become one of the hallmarks of his fledgling administration. But as many have noted, this posturing echoes developments closer to home. It was Michael Gove, of course, who claimed during the Brexit campaign that “[people in this country have had enough of experts](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote)”.

**Conspiracy theories: why people need to believe that the truth is hidden out there**

Scott Pruitt, the new chief of the US Environmental Protection Agency, certainly seems comfortable [dismissing scientific consensus](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/09/epa-scott-pruitt-carbon-dioxide-global-warming-climate-change): “I believe that measuring, with precision, human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact. So, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.”

From a certain perspective, this is knockabout political theatre. And a little scepticism is prudent, for sure. Blithely accepting whatever we’re told is clearly unwise. Information can be unreliable; cover-ups do occur. But if we dismiss everything we hear in the media, [if we assume that scientists and scholars are untrustworthy](http://www.thebrokenwindow.net/papers/L/LskyetalPsychScienceinPressClimateConspiracy.pdf), we leave ourselves vulnerable to manipulation, misinformation, and rumour. This makes us wonder: are we entering a golden age of the conspiracy theory?

Not that this type of cognitive error is new, of course. The idea that individuals or groups have conspired to commit some crime and then cover it up reaches back centuries — witness, for example, the belief that Jews were poisoning wells and killing Christians or that Roman Catholics were secretly plotting to undermine the Protestant English state. However, if we’re now living in a “post-truth” society, with traditionally trusted sources of information routinely undermined and informal communication possible like never before via the Internet, one of the dubious fruits of this febrile climate may be a growth in the power and reach of conspiracy theories.

What makes such ideas so credible for some people? Why, in the face of all available evidence and despite apparent public consensus to the contrary, would a person believe that the [moon landings were faked](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Stieger/publication/236035275_Lunar_Lies_The_Impact_of_Informational_Framing_and_Individual_Differences_in_Shaping_Conspiracist_Beliefs_About_the_Moon_Landings/links/0c96051f54b7d785ce000000.pdf), that the [Aids virus was created by the US government](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845717/), or that the [British security services murdered Princess Diana](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/09/17/38-brits-princess-dianas-death-was-not-accident/) to prevent a marriage to the Muslim Dodi Al-Fayed? Are some groups more likely to endorse conspiracy theories than others? And, if so, what do we know about the characteristics of these people?

As we discovered when we went looking for answers to these questions, specific [scientific studies of conspiracy beliefs](http://www.ask-force.org/web/Discourse/Sunstein-Conspiracy-Theories-2009.pdf) are few and far between. And so we began by seeing what we could discover from general epidemiological surveys, mining their findings in search of associations between particular social and psychological factors and a belief in conspiracy theories. With Richard Bentall of the University of Liverpool we turned to the rich dataset of one of the largest surveys of psychological health ever carried out: the [US National Comorbidity Survey-Replication](https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/publishedpaper_kessler_background.pdf). The NCS-R is a few years old now: it was carried out in 2001-03, predating the current skeptical turn. But it was large, nationally representative, and scientifically robust. The results of our research are published today.

Why are conspiracy theories so attractive? podcast

The NCS-R covers a lot of ground, but one of the statements participants were asked to consider was this: “I’m convinced there’s a conspiracy behind many things in the world.” More than a quarter of those who responded to the item felt that it was true – a statistic that provides food for thought in itself. And that was fifteen years ago.

These people had several things in common. They were, for example, more likely to be male and unmarried. But what really struck us were the above-average levels of social disadvantage. Here was a group with lower levels of education and income. They were more likely to be from an ethnic minority. They were more likely to carry a weapon. [Religious attendance may help mitigate some of the effects of disadvantage](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327965PLI1303_04); this group was [far less likely to go to services regularly](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/101/6/1278/).

It wasn’t just demographic characteristics that the conspiracy theorists shared. They tended to report lower levels of physical and psychological wellbeing; and to see themselves as socially inferior, both in comparison to their local community and to the nation as a whole. They were more likely to have seriously considered suicide. Their social networks were weaker (they often felt, for example, that they couldn’t rely on friends and family in times of trouble) and they found it harder to maintain secure relationships.

Childhood relationships with parents had frequently been challenging. Often these individuals hadn’t lived with both biological parents; they’d spent extended periods away from home; or had experienced violence at the hands of their parents.

Finally, the conspiracy theorists were more likely to meet the [criteria for all types of psychological disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2847357/pdf/nihms176704.pdf), including anxiety, depression, ADHD, and alcohol and drug problems.

What we see then is a clear association between a belief in conspiracy theories and a wide range of negative life circumstances and personal distress. So far an association is all it is. Do these types of problems make the people affected especially susceptible to conspiracy theories or is it the other way around? That research hasn’t been done. But our view is that the low self-esteem, smaller social networks, and marginalisation we see in so many of the US sample may play a key role at an early age, providing fertile ground for a distrust of authority: feeling that society has rejected them, they learn to reject the beliefs that society endorses.

Experiences like this in childhood may have a lasting effect on the way we make sense of the world. When an event occurs that doesn’t fit our expectations or that seems threatening, we feel anxious and disturbed. We want certainty and reassurance. Rather than thinking it through, we’re liable to jump to conclusions, to look for the answers that conform to our preconceptions rather than calmly weighing up the evidence.

The upshot of that process may be a conspiracy theory. In the short term, it’s a belief that brings benefits — in place of anxiety and uncertainty, we are soothed by what feels like knowledge. Our bruised self-esteem is boosted by the sense that we are one of the small minority who really know what’s going on. And thanks to the Internet we’re able to connect with these like-minded souls: suddenly we can feel part of a community.

Psychological models of conspiracy theories need testing, for sure. Indeed, we don’t know enough about conspiracy theories full stop. But given the current socio-political climate has this kind of research ever been more necessary?

Until we start to make dealing with this a priority, and avoid military conflicts abroad which further destabalises regions of the world, the world is going to get more unsafe. We have the technology, we have enough wealth to share, we just have to do it.

Regarding climate: The EU's carbon emissions have fallen quite a lot over the last 10 years.

The idea that we have much control over climate change does not stand up to reality.

Just have companies change to paper biodegradable bags, not tell people to use less or bring their own. We can't rely on that.

But what we can do, is make it so when you need a bag for your groceries, plastic isn't a option.

I truly believe people don't care what they use, just that when it comes time to needing a bag or straw or their meat, it's there for them",,
443,e9tj076,"Kinda, sorta. The issue was really how my classes collided. I'm a chemical engineering/business double major so although my business classes dont clash with each other, and my chemE classes dont clash, the business profs and chemE profs dont communicate when it comes to scheduling shit. Plus I was a bit under the weather, here at UT in downtown Austin it got to 30smth degrees way too fucking fast man. I'm  a Houston boi, we ain't used to this cold weather. Climate change is real and a problem. You know apparently HTown got snow before NYC and other northern cities? wtf",,
444,hnxiqze,"Thats very helpful info, thanks. However, that only accounts for part of the issue. The other risks we have include running out of material (rare earth elements are by their nature rare, and thus unsustainable), the emissions caused by generating enough electricity to keep these new batteries charged, and the emissions caused while recycling (or not) these batteries. It's also worth noting that you could completely eliminate passenger vehicles, and we would still have rampant o2, methane, and other greenhouse gas induced climate change.

I'm not saying electric vehicles won't help. Putting cardboard in the recycling bin instead of the garbage bin even helps. But to think this is anything approaching a viable solution on its own, or worse thinking non-military vehicles are the top cause of pollution, is dangerous. 

Alternative, green fuels and lubricants would be a more sustainable solution in my opinion. They would also help farmers by being able to sell more of their crops, including the soil cover grasses they use to protect their fields between farming seasons.",,
445,f195qi5,"That's an entirely false comparison. ""Political Science"" and actual science are entirely different fields- and I'd like to note I haven't met a single marxist so far that doesn't believe in climate change.    
And claiming that something's right just because its accepted is a textbook example of the *argumentum ad populum* fallacy.",,
446,d7lunwd,"It's ""empty words"" because Trump has literally in no way demonstrated how he will reverse what you perceive as Obama's failings. Seriously, what actionable ideas has he brought to the table to remedy any of the issues you raise? ""Build a wall"" is not a cure-all. He *cites* problems, many of which are unfortunately inherent or embedded or will take decades to fix, but he has no idea how to fix them. 

You're entitled to your opinion that Obama's been a failure, but I can almost guarantee you that history will say otherwise. Race relations have not worsened under him. Social media has just brought them to the forefront. There has been a 75-month streak of job growth, unemployment is at 4.9%, more Americans are getting health insurance coverage (roughly 19 million since the ACA, and the rate of uninsured is the lowest it's ever been), we have made *huge* strides as a global leader in climate change, gay marriage was legalized, Wall Street reform, he revived the auto industry, signed a new GI Bill. What more do you want? Or are all your reasons ad hominem?

The answer is not regression. There is a reason why the *vast* majority of intellectuals in America and abroad are anti-Trump.",,

Consensus Statements by academies of science:

**American Physical Society: Statement on Climate Change**

""The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now."" (November 2007)

**American Association for the Advancement of Science: AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change**

""The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society."" (December 2006)


**American Chemical Society: Statement on Global Climate Change**


""There is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real (and particularly strong within the past 20 years), that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century."" (July 2004)

**U.S. National Academy of Sciences: Understanding and Responding to Climate Change**

""The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."" (2005)

**International academies: Joint science academies’ statement: Global response to climate change**

""Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring."" (2005, 11 national academies of science)

**International academies The Science of Climate Change**

""Despite increasing consensus on the science underpinning predictions of global climate change, doubts have been expressed recently about the need to mitigate the risks posed by global climate change. We do not consider such doubts justified."" (2001, 16 national academies of science)


And there're many others...

I've been compiling a comprehensive list of statements. Most statements are signed by many academies:


1. ""The balance of the scientific evidence demands effective steps now to avert damaging changes to Earth's climate.""	http://science.sciencemag.org/content/292/5520/1261								

2. ""…there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001). This warming has already led to changes in the Earth’s climate.""	http://nationalacademies.org/onpi/06072005.pdf								

3. It is unequivocal that the climate is changing, and it is very likely that this is predominantly caused by the increasing human interference with the atmosphere. These changes will transform the environmental conditions on Earth unless counter-measures are taken.	https://www.pik-potsdam.de/aktuelles/nachrichten/dateien/G8_Academies%20Declaration.pdf		
						
4. ""The problem of global warming, climate change and their negative impact on the human life and the functioning of the whole society is one of the most dramatic of contemporary challenges. The most recent studies indicate that the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased in the last century by about 25%""	http://www.planetaziemia.pan.pl/GRAF_aktual/Stan_ZO-PAN.pdf								

5. ""climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems.""	http://www.nationalacademies.org/includes/climatechangestatement.pdf
								
6. ""The IPCC 2007 Fourth Assessment of climate change science concluded that large reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases, principally CO2, are needed soon to slow the increase of atmospheric concentrations, and avoid reaching unacceptable levels. However, climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global CO2 emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid. Feedbacks in the climate system might lead to much more rapid climate changes. The need for urgent action to address climate change is now indisputable.""	http://www.leopoldina.org/en/press/press-releases/press-release/press/713/	
							
7. ""It is widely agreed that human activities are changing Earth’s climate beyond natural climatic fluctuations. The emission and accumulation of greenhouse gases associated with the burning of fossil fuels, along with other activities, such as land use change, are the principal causes of climate change… climate change poses a significant threat to human health in many direct and indirect ways… Although there are some uncertainties about the magnitude of climate change and its impacts, there is widespread consensus that to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact on health, near term deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are needed. "" http://www.leopoldina.org/de/publikationen/detailansicht/publication/health-effects-of-climate-change-2010/
								
8. ""It is now more certain than ever, based on many lines of evidence, that humans are changing Earth’s climate. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, accompanied by sea-level rise, a strong decline in Arctic sea ice, and other climate-related changes.
The evidence is clear. However, due to the nature of science, not every single detail is ever totally settled or completely certain. Nor has every pertinent question yet been answered.
Scientific evidence continues to be gathered around the world, and assumptions and findings about climate change are continually analysed and tested. ""	http://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/events/a-discussion-on-climate-change-evidence-and-causes/	
							
9. ""The atmosphere's GHG content has increased steadily and steadily in recent decades. An in-depth analysis of these GHGs, particularly their isotopic composition, shows unequivocally that this change in the composition of the atmosphere is directly or indirectly linked to human activity (anthropogenic origin) ... The speed of global climate change announced is likely to be unprecedented ... In these conditions, the international community must resolutely and globally commit itself to a voluntarist and ambitious approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions."" http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/Climat20141113Final21561.pdf	
							
10. ""The scientific evidence is now overwhelming that the climate is warming and that human activity is largely responsible for this change through emissions of greenhouse gases""	https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2015/21-07-15-climate-communique.PDF								

11. ""The science of climate change reported by the IPCC Fourth Assessment (2007) and Fifth Assessment (2014) have been thoroughly evaluated by numerous national academies (e.g. Royal Society/National Academy of Sciences, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) and by international bodies. Advances in science and technology have increased our knowledge of how to mitigate climate change, uncertainties in the scientific analysis continue to be ...

And again, you're arguing the nuance of addressing a problem. That's not a defense of those who deny its very existence. 

It's not my duty to educate you on climate change. You have failed your country that you are at a computer, arguing it's not THAT big of a deal, and don't access information yourself that will show climate change is, among experts, uncontroversial in its very real and present danger.  

So lemme say again, yes, shame on you. ",,

455,fhomul6,"Your future? Sorry, not so good sweetie.  Your chances of making it to adulthood without getting molested or worse is very low bc we don't believe in feminism.  You're really special only bc of the genes inside your eggs and once we get those, well I hope you cook, clean, and have a high tolerance for domestic abuse.

And about those eggs.  They're not yours.  I mean, sure they're your DNA and inside your body but we get to tell you what to do with it.  Hint, it's to reproduce with a white man.  We'll shame you for using it for any other purpose, and deny you autonomy and proper healthcare for any fetal tissue.

Let's hope you weren't born gay, bc we'll beat that out of you.  Possibly destroy you financially as again, you basically stole our eggs.  You have no respect for the work your father and friends put in to keeping non whites out just so they don't spoil that seed, and now you want to waste it on Becky?  You just need a real man to make you straight.

The future isn't good sweetie.  We don't believe in science so medical research is stalling, climate change turned out to be real, and we have no answers for diabetes and heart disease.  Shut up and eat your Hardee's.

Instinctively your brain will make up the reasons why you should live before the other guy. (Any reason: age, past errors etc) the same happens in real world. People would put their welfare first then everybody else. It’s easy to imagine something that benefits everyone but when you are in the position to do it you will think on you first( I know it sounds selfish but it’s just human nature) that’s why there is corruption in government for example. That’s why you observe people that has so much money they can’t spend it all (but they want more money) that’s why you have corporate that doesn’t give a f about climate change because there’s money behind it and if there’s money behind it why would you stop?",,

467,huhxbb2,"""The government"" ....

If I had a dollar for every post or comment in these UFO subs that assume a monolithic global government control office somewhere.

For god's sake, people, read a book or a newspaper now and then. There is no ""the government."" There are hundreds of nations on this planet. There are *thousands* of ""governments"" within the United States alone -- and it's obvious most of you around here believe the United States government (which one?) controls not only everything that is seen flashing over a corn field somewhere in the USA, but also the entire planet, and the entire galaxy around it.

If you live in an American city, or I'm guessing suburb for this group, there are *dozens* of ""governments"" all around you, and other than bitching at each other few of them have any idea what the others do. There's a civilian agency that handles airport traffic, at the federal and regional levels. There are state, federal, county and municipal governments that deal with air pollution, highways, farm animal food safety, building regulations, health departments, social security and old-age benefits, toy packaging, testing of dental hygiene products, thousands of interactions regarding trade, immigration, climate change policy and wildlife movements between the many continents and hundreds of individual nations. *There is no all-powerful government that controls ANYTHING on this planet.* Governments of the largest/richest countries don't even control space flight, or rocket launches, or the thousands of SpaceX privately-launched internet satellites now screwing up astronomy photography and research around the world.

Have you heard about catastrophic climate change? Inflation? Supply chain breakdowns? Russia and the Ukraine? Hong Kong and Taiwan? The oceans heating up and our supplies of food in the oceans grinding to a halt? How about the rapid population decline because *people have stopped having children*, around the world, and neither totalitarian China or ""here's money to have a baby"" Western Europe can do anything about it?

Please, *please*, take just a moment before you post these things and ask yourself, ""What am I talking about when I claim 'the government' is going to finally tell me about the space aliens? What do I even mean?""",,

469,dnjmzn6,"&gt;No one has even built a 4th generation plant, let alone a fucking assembly line for them

Russia has.  See the [BN-800 Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor)  The US has built several prototypes.  See [Experimental Breeder Reactor II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_Breeder_Reactor_II).  NuScale is starting to build their first prototype of a factory built reactor.  


&gt; wire them to a bunch of batteries to provide 24/7 power.

The reason why nuclear is cheaper then renewables is storage.  If you actually think batteries are the solution you are mistaken.  Let's do some math. 

The US uses almost 4000 TWh annually. Divide that by 365 and you get ~11 TWh. Multiple that by 14(2 weeks) and you get ~150 TWh. Divide that by 100 MWh and multiple that by $25 million (the storage and cost of a tesla battery wear house) and you get a cost of ~$37.5 trillion. The actual cost will be higher because of grid improvements required to utilize this storage. So that gives an estimate of $40 trillion for a mere 2 weeks of storage.  That is not economically viable.  

The real reason people are not pursuing nuclear is the cost of natural gas is currently very low.  It will still kill us, but we will save a buck.  You see climate change is real.   
",,
470,geow9de,"it's not about removing the companies. It's about making sure they are held accountable for their emissions. Everyone going vegan isn't gonna change emissions for manufacturing industries. Oil industries. Exxonmobil has known for 40 years about climate change, they didn't share their info and just kept on emitting. Stop acting like companies are acting in good faith, most of them are not. Most want to maximize profits and they do that by not giving a shit about the environment or wellbeing of their animals. Like I said most people won't even be able to afford to go fully vegan to substitute all the nutritients they'd miss.

478,hghwdhw,"The republicans clinging to power need the populace to be under educated.  It’s easier to control and manipulate under educated people.  That’s how they stay in power.  They demonize education, bringing up shit like CRT that isn’t even a factor in public education until college, really.  But they want what their kids learn to be very SELECTIVE to the things that keep the republicans in charge.  If you start teaching them real history you realize it’s not so hunky dory all the time, so they want to white wash and pretend we never committed atrocities in the settlement of this land.  They want kids to be good little Neo-Christian-racist-ignorant wage slaves that don’t stir the pot and god forbid, think for themselves.  I think the GQP knows this, that the Republican Party is doomed if the populace is well-educated.  So schools dive deeper into a state of state-sponsored education.  Just like the Germans did during the rise of fascism in the early 20th.  We would all be much more aware of this if our education system weren’t so abused and neglected on purpose by the right.  Hell, the left politicians are complicit in this too.  It’s all a vicious cycle.  Problem is, we’re always the ones who get screwed.  Not the politicians.  That being said though, I know I’m right because why the fuck would Betsy Devos have any reason to be education secretary during the Trump regime when she had ABSOLUTELY ZERO qualifications for the role.  At every turn she was helping public schools get fucked more all the while ensuring rich, private feeder schools were very well equipped.  Paying teachers in public schools what we have allowed as the standard is an abomination that can only be explained as a sheer way to keep good people from wanting to do it so we always have this problem.  If you wanted the populace to be well educated, teachers would be paid as well as doctors and lawyers.  There would be abundant resources for them.  Not what we are seeing in real life.

The math thing is probably another way to retain control because if people can’t do math, science etc etc, well they won’t be researching climate change, and no one will care any more about it while we all suffer from it and the powers that be can keep making money without doing anything about it.

&gt;To answer this question in an uncontroversial way, you’d have to first get everyone to agree on **what counts as intersex** —and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female. That’s hard to do. How small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex? Do you count “sex chromosome” anomalies as intersex if there’s no apparent external sexual ambiguity?1 (Alice Dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex.)

As it turns out, the actual, scientific definitions for male and female aren't obvious or plainly inscribed in nature. They're categories with blurry edges. In a given case, some doctors might determine a person to be male while others might determine the same person to be intersex. Or one doctor might determine somebody to be female at one point, but then, as sex anatomy variations make themselves apparent later in life, decide that an intersex classification is more fitting. There simply don't exist catch-all criteria by which everybody in the world can be grouped as M or F. And the criteria that do exist for determining whether somebody is M or F tends to be political, and tends to change in response to political climate at least as much as it does in response to medical breakthroughs.

""Male"" and ""female"" are abstractions. They're categories that we've invented to help us describe the natural and social world. But now we're beginning to find that these particular abstractions don't seem to be quite as infallible as we might once have thought them to be. I suspect that a different abstraction -- one that conceptualizes sex and gender as a continuum -- might be more scientifically rigorous here.

&gt; At the forefront of the fight are a number of climate skeptics who have long exploited the imperfections of scientific research — statistical margins of error, the subjective elements of projective modeling — to cast doubt on the conclusive finding that humans have contributed to global warming.

&gt; Steven J. Milloy, a fervent denier of that scientific consensus, was early to play down the coronavirus threat. He compared it to the flu, an argument that public health officials say dangerously underestimates how deadly the virus is.

&gt; One policy group that has expressed skepticism about climate change, the Heartland Institute, pointed to a widely used projection of 60,000 deaths to attack earlier models predicting up to two million fatalities. The critique, posted on its website on April 17, ignored the fact that the lower estimate took into account social-distancing measures, and that the high estimate and others close to it were presented as worst-case scenarios if no steps were taken to mitigate the virus’s spread. (The 60,000-death projection was rendered null and void 13 days later, when the death toll surpassed that number.)

&gt; Few of those who tacked from climate skepticism to Covid-19 denialism have any real expertise in tracking pandemics. But several are funded by industries that have long sought to question the work of scientists, such as big oil companies like Exxon Mobil and tobacco companies like Philip Morris. They are also backed by conservative groups like the Mercer Family Foundation that hold immense sway inside the Trump White House, and are deeply invested in the president’s political future.

&gt; ""It’s the same individuals. It’s the same modus operandi, the same organizations and the same backers,” said Michael E. Mann, who directs the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. “Right-wing conservative interests that are benefiting from the Trump presidency obviously want to see a continuation with the Trump presidency.”

&gt; The lines of attack against the conclusions of health experts are familiar to those who have studied the climate-change denial movement, which has long relied on what Naomi Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard, called “motivated reasoning.”

&gt; ""It’s, ‘I don’t like what this implies; therefore I’m going to deny the evidence, and I’m going to question the models, and I’m going to question the motivations of the people who do it,”’ Dr. Oreskes said.

&gt; For instance, Todd Starnes, a conservative radio host who has likened climate change to “the Tooth Fairy,” fed the virus “truther” movement when he argued that the crisis was overstated because he did not see crowds outside the Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York. It was the pandemic-era equivalent of pointing to a snowstorm as evidence that the planet is not warming.

With Universal Healthcare, the tax money is a large issue. However, people fail to recognize that not only does the US spend more per capita on health than the majority of the developed world, universal healthcare could still exist while lowering the tax cost for the average person.

Likely through the near immediate rise in something like crime (leading to more spending on police and prison) or the long term effects of your population being less educated and less competitive in a changing world.

The same thing with climate change. *eventually* we are going to pay the price of it. We're already feeling the effects as certain commodities go up. When crop yields are lower, food costs go up. Even things like wine will likely increase this year due to a frost in California's vineyards reducing yields by half. We eventually *will* have to spend money to ""salvage"" fresh water supplies or desalinate water. If it's even possible to do. But to bring it back to healthcare, again, climate change is detrimental to human health. In nearly every capacity. But fixing climate change, you spend less in the future to 'reverse' the effects (if possible) and you'll also be spending less on healthcare.

The problem is knowing how much road left you have to kick the can down. Eventually you have to face the issues you're putting off. If your ""single issue"" is climate change, then there are probably a myriad of other issues that you should also care about. Arguably, including abortion. Since allowing people to voluntarily terminate pregnancies will overall reduce the population (in a way that is not genocidal, but actually consensual). You cannot be ""pro climate reform"" while also advocating for humans to not be allowed to access abortions. You cannot be ""pro climate reform"" without wanting a population that is more educated.

Plus the whole point of yucca mountain is to deal with the existing nuclear waste problem of the last 70 years so that you would even bring up the cost of new plants makes no sense as an argument. ",,
524,guhor4v,"Cheaper in what? The cost per kWh is still fairly aggressive for nuclear power... And aside from construction/dismantling this is a zero-carbon energy.

Wont comment on water release, looks bad but probably the less worse of the options... What is the gain to do this given the bad image it is going to give? Probably they simply run out of other good options.

Interestingly enough, they stopped nearly their entire nuclear activity after the incident, probably out of panic. Truth is, they realised quickly that they had to restart a fair bit of them... Starts being annoying when you have no light at home or the subway is not working anymore...

Could we define long term? There are some options on the table, dig a hole, put in there, put soil back on top. Not high tech, not particularly satisfying, but it works. Otherwise, surgeneration. There are some solutions.

Even if renewables are actually cheaper (which is not necessarily the case), what about the carbon footprint of it? A failed nuclear reactor will not bankrupt a country... A company, sure. A country? Naaaaa. The bit on sensitive to major disasters is interesting. This is why you usually do not build them in random places. And there is some safety features. And even with fukushima, japan is ok, country is still running to my knowledge. Major disasters in civil nuclear are quite low for the overall amount of reactors built and running... This is a bit like the plane... A crash is bad, but this is still one of the safest mean of transportation...and how about the windfarm and solar are going to cope with the inevitable change of climate? Who says that in 20 years, wind will blow the same speed/direction and the sky being this clear all year round? Some of the change we are facing in a few decades will happen independently if we go renewable or not. Inertia in the system is too big. This is too late for that, have to have some resilient and previsible way of producing energy.",,

&gt; thousands of cascading offshoots, created for the sole purpose of empowering one group of people over another, and justifying genocide.

Yes, I agree those are the apparent purposes of the people who start and lead those groups. I doubt that would be the purpose of a God, but that's just me. 

&gt; If a perfect being built everything, including the building blocks of life and the very laws of physics that this universe is governed by, tending to a tiny by comparison to the UNIVERSE group of smart apes shouldn't be difficult to manage.

I agree, objectively speaking. 

Nonetheless you can’t be sure right now, being relatively powerless, what you would do with that much power. We are relatively powerless right now, assuming a God. For all we know, my or your thoughts as to what we’d do with supernatural powers could be like a toddler believing if it had the power of his parents he would make life all good by stabbing the psycho his parents bring him to once in a while, the one in the white coat that stabs and bleeds him, 100x more than he’s been stabbed, to teach that nutjob a lesson he’ll never forget and hopefully let his parents know who’s boss now.

&gt; Instead, we have thousands of current and extinct religions, clearly thought up by primitive people, desperately or opportunisticly making up whatever nonsense they could think of to explain away all of the things outside of their control or power to observe scientifically. 

Agreed. They are among the most dangerous people on Earth, perhaps in all of universal history. 

&gt; There is no evidence, whatsoever that one religion is any more or less right than another, 

Yes, no objective evidence that is. There are claims to subjective evidence, and that's about all we can say (and that doesn't make the claims reliable of course, at least not to an objective thinker).

&gt; because there is literally no evidence that ANY of them are right.

Not to the objective thinker there isn't. I can't speak to anyone else's subjective experiences with God, 'the word of God,' etc. except to say, objectively speaking, there is like a 99.999999999999% chance they are wrong, confused, lying, ill, etc.

&gt; Instead, we have literally billions of people over the course of human history massacring and eradicating other people from history. All because they believed in one prophet over another, or disagreed with magic fairy tales 

Humans massacre one another for a lot more reasons than religion. Any time the chance for power, pride, or bullying presents itself, humans destroy one another. We ('they') do this with religion but not only with religion. 

The bully mentality, or the presumption-of-absolute-self-correctness may be a better description of the mentality, rears its head when power and pride becomes available and humans lack necessary self-control. This happens often in religion, especially going by the volume level of a certain subset of all who profess religion (the most evangelistic and ""certain"" of their own and everyone elses' exact status for all eternity). It is really a human error that can be found in a lot of easily-misunderstood contexts though. It can probably be found in most of us at one time or another in our lives, and I am the worst offender I know of (as far as my limited knowledge of my and others' lives and intentions is concerned).

For instance someone from one political party might say, “you don't see politics the way I do, therefore you are wrong,” or someone from one corporate lobby might say, “you don’t see banking regulation like I do, therefore you’re wrong.” Some scientist even, highly educated and on the payroll of some soulless corporation, might stuff a wad of cash in his pocket and say, ""You don't see climate data like I do, therefore you're wrong."" I feel like bullies are often attracted to religious thought, but not only to religion. They are often attracted to power and pride, and tricking people about religion can be powerful and create room for pride. There are even immature atheists out there that will bully people though, maybe even troll theists, saying “you don’t understand rationality like I do, therefore you’re wrong about divinity,” (even though we can only speak of probabilities with regards to anything outside of our realm of knowledge, and especially as to anything theoretically existing outside of the universe).

&gt; God didn't do it. 

Possibly. One understanding of Christianity is as progressive revelation, revelation to individuals (and really to societies) as they become more able and willing to accept better ideas, kind of like a therapist with a young patient that can't tackle all their problems at once quite yet. Progressive revelation (both societally and individually) is believed to be necessary because of how impossibly difficult to reach the human heart, or rather entire societies of human hearts, was, can be through time, is.

God might be doing that.

God probably isn't though, objectively speaking, if we assume God. That said... it is still a possibility... technically speaking. 

&gt; People made up a story about it and those people didn't know a better way.

A better way to do what? And with regards to whatever your answer is... do you know a better way to accomplish it now? 

If you think so, what's the difference between you and them that makes you more able? If they didn't have whatever you have, how then have we progressed from then until now? Purely despite them? Or are any good qualities of those who came before us, even with all their flaws, part of the reason we've progressed to where we are?

Have we come this far exclusively by AMv8-ism? Or have theists also helped make society ""better"" since then (in whatever way you're defining good)?

I, for one, can't say if ""they"" knew a better way than us or not. Maybe they didn't. Maybe did know a better way though, deep down, but didn't want to accept, practice, or rely on it? Maybe they were just nearly impossible to convince of that better way, even if we could go back in time to them knowing what we know now... even though our words may be true. In that case, perhaps even God couldn't tell them everything at that time lest they abuse the power that comes with great knowledge. 

In that case, maybe God can't tell us everything right now, lest we abuse the power that comes with great knowledge. First we'd have to be convinced to use the power responsibly... and what that would mean would be subjective to God. If there is a God (huge assumption objectively, I know), then God has the characteristics God has whether we want God to have them or not. So it could be difficult to convince us of His omnibenevolent existence until we developed enough to accept those characteristics of His that we might wish were not.

Convincing someone of something is a lot harder than telling someone something. For instance, right now some scientist may be debating with another scientist about the next possible theorem that explains something about the universe. One might ""know"" (be fully convinced of) the answer. The other might think the first one is twisting the implications of a previous theorem to come to an irrational conclusion. They both might even become convinced the other is twisting things... until the most reasonable answer prevails. This can all take time because we (humans) tend to try to remain convinced of what we already ""know,"" that is, what we're already convinced of. Most of us don't even like to admit simple mistakes, even though we know we are human, and most of us dislike fundamental changes to our views of how the world works even more. Change makes us uncomfortable and many of us avoid it. However, if progress is necessary, change is too. So it takes time for us to become convinced that we may need to change.

It can be very difficult, sometimes even seemingly impossible to convince a human being of something... even if that something true. Add in societies of other humans helping one another avoid a truth... and all hell can break loose. The thing about religion is it can often be understood two ways, backwards or forwards. This is because it has necessarily had to evolve as humans have and (more importantly) as society has become willing to accept the changes it ('they'/'we') needs to make. It is a process of slow societal improvement. However, we are societies of errant beings, and we tend to follow those among us not who are the most truthful but who are the most charismatic and authoritative. See American politics and really any politics. A bully with a Bible can treat it like a data dump, grab whatever ancient, misunderstood stories or rules he wants to, rip them out of context or ignore key sections, and then basically just use it to scare and control people. Written communication is especially susceptible to this sort of twisting. However, I believe this same sort of misunderstanding about God, this same sort of refusal to be convinced of something true about God, could happen even if God chose to reveal Himself physically or even mentally ('spiritually') to everyone in obvious ways, instead of using 'hearsay' in scripture. 

It seems like it would be easy, to us. If we assume a God (hypothetically), then I believe in reality changing our hearts toward God is probably quite difficult and comes slowly, especially with regards to societal change.",,

527,im5su4b,"A summary of **Chapter 29: Pitching** (Part 2/2)

\- **The Sussexes are displeased the trustees would have control over the money:** *By the end of the meeting the Sussexes were shocked. The trustees, they discovered, were ‘neither mates nor servants’. They were independents who would have complete control of the charity’s money. Under the law, the Sussexes would be denied any privacy over the Foundation’s management. For Meghan, a master of control, the legal requirement of transparency was unexpected. The Foundation’s legal structure, she believed, was a deliberate bid to undermine her.*  
  
\- **Harry and Meghan are even more motivated to leave the UK:** *Once Meghan discovered that the Sussex Foundation could not operate in secrecy, another reason to stay in Britain had disappeared. Money was critical to her...Harry was similarly incensed. Charles had assured him of a major role in the slimmed-down monarchy for at least ten years. Now, the discrepancy of treatment between William and himself confirmed the worst. He also wanted out. Meghan was not disappointed by his decision.*  
  
\- **July 2019, The Sussexes attempt to land deals in LA in preparation of their exit**: *The anger fuelling their urgency to leave Britain was transmitted to Los Angeles. Nick Collins was told to start looking for acting roles for Meghan. Her business agent, Andrew Meyer, was also asked to look into the possibility of negotiating a mammoth deal, similar to the Obamas, with Netflix. In parallel, she was encouraged by David Furnish, Elton John’s partner, to co-operate on an animation series.*  
  
\- **14th July 2019, Harry and Meghan at the Lion King premier:** *In the line-up that evening she did not hide her desperation. Pharrell Williams, the rapper, told her that he was ‘so happy’ about their marriage and added, ‘We cheer you guys on.’ Touching his arm, Meghan smiled: ‘Thank you. They don’t make it easy.’ Minutes later, Harry was speaking to Jon Favreau, the film’s director. ‘If anyone needs any extra voiceover work,’ he began, only to be interrupted by Meghan. ‘That’s really why we’re here,’ she said. ‘It’s the pitch!’ Harry praised Meghan’s acting abilities. Next, Harry approached Robert Iger, Disney’s chief executive famous for the quip, ‘They only root for you in Hollywood when your cancer is terminal.’ ‘You do know she does voiceovers?’ the prince asked Iger. ‘I did not know that,’ replied the executive. ‘You seem surprised,’ said Harry. ‘She’s really interested.’ ‘Sure, we’d love to try,’ said Iger, grasping that the prince was touting for work. ‘That’s a great idea.’*  
  
\- **Summer 2019, Meghan takes no official maternity leave:** *She was counting the weeks until her return to California. Her spokeswoman said that Meghan would not be taking maternity leave because she wanted to prove herself through work. Yet other than one engagement to promote Smart Works, she undertook no public work during the summer. She watched polo and tennis matches, and repeatedly flew in private jets for holiday trips with Harry and Archie. They stayed with Elton John in St Tropez, the Clooneys in Como, and in a friend’s seven-bedroomed villa advertised at £100,000 per week in Ibiza’s Vista Alegre estate. For Meghan, it seemed taking private jets was like ordering an Uber.*  
  
\- ***""To silence the calls of ‘hypocrisy’, Meghan’s publicists once again contacted her friends.*** *The result was a synchronised chorus of support. ‘I am calling on the press,’ said Elton John, ‘to cease these relentless and untrue assassinations on their character that are spuriously crafted on an almost daily basis.’ Jessica Mulroney posted on Instagram, ‘Shame on you, you racist bullies. Three years of undeserved hate and abuse. It’s enough.’ Actress Jameela Jamil justified the private jets as protection for the public: ‘It’s not safe for us to be on the same planes . . . They are prime targets for kidnap and sometimes assassination.’""*  
  
\- **Early August 2019, Harry travelled by private jet and helicopter to the Google camp, Sicily, to speak about the climate-change crisis:** *His plane was just one of the 114 private jets, as well as a fleet of super yachts, that had ferried billionaires and celebrities to the festival. Free from the constraints of palace etiquette, Harry tasted a movie star’s freedom alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Orlando Bloom and singer-songwriter Harry Styles. As royals, both he and Meghan felt entitled to use their status to lecture others. ‘Every choice,’ Harry wrote at the same time on the Sussexes’ Instagram page, ‘every footprint, every action makes a difference.’ Like his hosts, Harry justified his use of private jets ‘to protect my family from these people’. The identity of ‘these people’ and the ‘never-ending’ threat Harry perceived, remained unclear.*  
  
\- **Harry holds a press conference in Amsterdam to promote the new online eco-travel campaign, Travalyst:** *He was outraged that his audience asked him to justify his use of private jets. In reply, Harry claimed that 99 per cent of his flights were commercial. Annoyed that his answers were scrutinised, Harry was encouraged by a hovering Sunshine Sachs executive to give evasive replies. He only flew private, he protested, to ‘ensure my family is safe’. In reality, at least 60 per cent of his flights were private. ‘No one is perfect,’ he then declared. ‘I plant trees to offset the carbon print.’ He was pressed to give answers. ‘Where and how many trees?’ he was asked. Questions sparked Harry’s sense of persecution. Whatever he said, Harry believed, was ‘the truth’. They were special people requiring protection. Just over one year later, Heather Wong, Travalyst executive director, resigned and was not replaced.*  
  
\- **The Cambridges fly commercial, Meghan refuses to follow them to Balmoral:** *The media was summoned to film them flying on a low-budget airline from Norwich to Aberdeen for their summer holidays at Balmoral. In revenge, Meghan promptly announced that her family would not, after all, follow the Cambridges to Balmoral. Archie, she explained, was too young at three months to travel by plane to Scotland. Instead, she flew with Archie to Ibiza. Later that same week, Meghan flew on a commercial flight to New York to watch Serena Williams play in the final of the US Open. Williams was defeated.*  
  
\- ***""Days later, Meghan and Harry flew by private jet to Misha Nonoo’s wedding in Rome.*** *Nonoo’s second husband, Mike Hess, was the son of an oil billionaire. Just the type Meghan enjoyed meeting – and Nonoo admired.""*

544,evy7f5b,"Greens, NDP, and Liberals all have plans that would work. None are perfect, though. 

The Greens are anti-nuclear and want to increase extraction of the oil sands (the dirtest source of oil in the world). Nor do they have a jobs plan. Greens are in general anti-labour. The NDP and Liberals targets arent aggressive enough. And the NDP isn't exactly pro nuclear but their reasons are based in the logistical issues of maintening those facilities rather than the anti-science fearmongering of the Greens. Utimately still a pretty poor reason to reject it though, and I find it frustrating.

The NDP will meet Paris, but the Liberals wont. The price on carbon needs to be about 130$ to meet the standard set by the IPCC report. The Liberals don't plan on taking it further than 50$. That's no where near enough. The Greens and NDP would both raise it to where it needs to be. 

The NDP plan has the most comprehensive plan, followed by the Greens, and lastly the Liberals. If Liberals would commit to 130$/ton, they would have a much better plan. And remember, it won't cost us anything more because of the rebate program.

Michael Chong's carbon pricing plan doesn't do a direct rebate, but uses the revenues to plan for income tax cuts. I personally find this problematic because the amount carbon being polluted will (hopefully) decrease rapidly over time meaning less revenue. It's much harder to raise income taxes than it is to phase out green energy rebates on electric vehicles, for example.

And yes, nuclear fission does indeed work well. How many hundreds of reactors are running currently? How many have already run their entire intended lifespan and more without major incident? A grand total of 28 nuclear ""CaTaStRoPhEs"" is an acceptably small number. How are you defining ""catastrophe"" anyway? You're not just going to the Wiki list of nuclear incidents and calling them all catastrophes, are you?

Nuclear power is safe in spite of a small number of catastrophic incidents in the same way flying is safe in spite of a small number of catastrophic incidents. 

Uranium occurs in nature. Nuclear fission is the reason the core of the planet is hot. There's even places where Madam Gaia has accidentally created a nuclear reactor herself, without regard to shielding or waste management, and life is just fine. See: Oklo natural nuclear reactor.

604,cz253vv,"&gt; When libertarians contradict themselves its because they are not applying their principles consistently. When a leftist or rightist contradicts themselves its because their principles are self contradictory.

When a libertarian or conservatives are accused of contradiction, it's because they set up a rigid absolutist framework that's unrealistic to uphold.  When leftists are accused of contradictions, it because the conservative is projecting their own moral framework on the leftist without recognizing the complexity and nuance.  Conservatives and libertarians recognize this divide as well, only they mischaracterize it as ""Logic vs. Emotion.""

So you end up with a lot of ""Michael Moore is a hypocrite because he says capitalism has flaws even though he's rich,"" ""Al Gore is a hypocrite because he says climate change is a problem but he also has a big house,"" ""Feminists are hypocrites because they don't want government involvement when it comes to birth control, but then they demand government involvement when they get raped.""  etc.

Most of the time, conservatives/libertarians frame government policy and privatization in terms of *quantity*, rather than *quality*.  So they frame the feminist example as ""Should government get involved?"" and see it as a contradiction, where as feminists frame it as ""Should women have the right to decide what happens to their bodies?"", and don't see it as a contradiction.  In the Michael Moore case, conservatives see it as ""Should rich people be allowed to exist?"", where as liberals see it as a question the money was earned.

&gt; Edit: Anarcho-capitalists are the libertarians that apply their principles consistently

Anarchy and capitalism are mutually exclusive ideals.

You cannot have private property under anarchy, simply because there's no way to enforce it.  My right to swing my nose ends where your nose begins.  Likewise, I should have absolute freedom of movement as long as I'm not touching you, just like you should have absolute freedom of movement as long as you're not touching me.  You have no right to restrict my movements if I never agreed to have them restricted.

Ancaps try to get around this by assuming that there's an implied consensus where everyone agreed to honor the property lines of everyone else.  But that's no different from a statist assuming that everyone agreed to sign a social contract.

No, there's not. There is, however, something *very* wrong with the government directly funding a ""tourist attraction"" that is build specifically to further a religious narrative and explicitly deny evolution.

&gt; The vice and AG are far from extreme historically, very moderate in reality.

What exactly do you mean by ""historically?"" What's your standard of comparison there? I mean, if you're taking into account the whole of history, hell, Pol Pot wasn't that terrible. But that's the problem with comparing how things were *historically* as a broad brush to modern situations. Anyway let's address the assertion that those two are ""very moderate,"" shall we?

Pence put forth the first bill to defund Planned Parenthood and has been the figurehead of the struggle to have it shut down ever since. He also co-sponsored bills to mandate ultrasounds prior to abortion and to re-define rape to limit access to abortion in jurisdiction where access is limited. He co-authored the dubiously named Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana, allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people and deny LGBT employees health coverage, and invited anti-LGBT lobbyists to stand behind him as he signed it into law as governor. In 2000 he stated before Congress that they “should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a ‘discrete and insular minority’ entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.” He also said that federal funds should not be “given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus,” instead advocated that the government should fund institutions that “provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" That is, conversion therapy - a highly-controversial and pseudoscientific measure condemned by the American Psychiatric Association as ""unethical."" Additionally Pence co-sponsored the Federal Marriage Amendment while in Congress and called restrictions on same-sex marriage ""God's idea."" As a member of Congress, Pence voted against measures that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and against the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The American Conservative Union even hailed him as “the most conservative vice presidential nominee the country has seen in 50 years.” The litany of his religious hyper-conservatism above barely scratches the surface.

As for Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, let's go ahead and point out that the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship in 1986 for being too extreme. In 2009 Sessions fought to derail the passing of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, asserting at a Judiciary Committee meeting (the same committee which had rejected his nomination 23 years previously) that he was “not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination.” Sessions was also one of just a handful of legislators to oppose the 2013 reauthorization and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act, citing his objections to (1) visas for immigrant women fleeing abusers, (2) non-discrimination provisions for LGBT survivors, and (3) protections for Native American survivors. In 2015 it was Sessions who led the opposition to a Judiciary Committee resolution reiterating the standing principle that the United States would not bar entry into the nation on grounds of religion. Maybe it's because I live in Alabama and am hyper-aware of the way this part of the country is represented by those who slither forth from here, but frankly I find it astounding that anyone with even the remotest knowledge of Sessions and his record can unironically assert that he is anything *but* a religious extremist and a xenophobe to boot.

&gt; Climate change has more complexity than you think, and there is no ""default federal stance"". Not that religion is directly tied with the issue anyway.

Thanks for telling me what *I* think, hoss. Yes, it is complex. However, there is a thoroughly-documented and well-reasoned consensus that the Earth's climate has shifted and is doing so at an increasing rate, exacerbated in no small part by human activity. This comes into direct conflict with the current administration's push for expansion of the coal industry, de-regulation of pollutants, weakening of the EPA, overturning of environmental protection laws, and a spate of ecologically harmful actions so expansive I find it difficult to believe you honestly think there is no default stance at play.

As for the idea that religion and climate change are mutually exclusive, well, they should be but they aren't. See, these are people who believe that if something isn't *directly* threatening them (at least in the imaginary way that healthcare for women or legal protections for LGBT citizens do), then they should just let the Almighty handle it. As Republican Representative Tim Walberg said during an address to his constituents in June of last year, ""As a Christian, I believe that there is a Creator in God who is much bigger than us And I’m confident that, if there’s a real problem, He can take care of it.” THAT is why it's an issue.

&gt; Bill Graham was a preacher who's given spiritual advice to about every president and MLK alike. I've got a feeling your quotes are out of context.

People in positions of power are not exempt from holding deplorable beliefs. Graham denied his anti-Semitic stance for decades, until the release of Nixon's tapes let the world hear him say that very quote about the ""Synagogue of Satan"" in his own voice. As for the AIDS quote, it came straight from a sermon in Columbus OH in 1993. The context, which you feel I've left out, is: “Is AIDS a judgment of God? I could not say for sure, but I think so.” Literally that he believed AIDS to be ""a judgment of God."" Years later he retracted the statement. That doesn't negate the fact that he used his platform as one of the most influential public orators of his time to spread that message.

Yes, you've ""got a feeling"" the quotes are out of context. I've ""got a feeling,"" too, that you're inclined to cast aspersion upon everything said here, regardless of what mountain of citations I present, because it doesn't fit your own narrative.

I don't have a problem with political leaders being religious. And I don't think that them being people of faith constitutes a stranglehold. I *do* believe, however, that conservative fundamentalist Christian institutions and their leaders have a disproportionate influence on the political discourse in America. I don't think it's a coincidence that one of the methods bandied about to discredit Bernie Sanders as a presidential candidate early in the Democratic race of 2016 was to use his ardent atheism against him. There's a HUGE difference in keeping the State from endorsing one particular faith and shaming its lawmakers for professing a faith. I'm advocating for the former, and pretending it's the latter is a red herring. Christians aren't under prosecution, there's no ""War Against Christianity."" Stop clutching your pearls.",,

634,d6jzt1q,"Read the content and ask yourself how it differs from the IPCC predictions.  The degree temperature rises match the effects that will be seen.  It's overly dramatic to underscore the severity of the situation.  

Most of the worlds climate scientists agree that it is already too late.  Don't take my word for it, take the IPCCs:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/effects-of-climate-change-irreversible-un-panel-warns-in-report/2014/11/01/2d49aeec-6142-11e4-8b9e-2ccdac31a031_story.html

What's needed is a wholesale shift in energy production and usage by industry and agriculture in every nation, and it needs to happen right now.  Barring that doing things on a small scale does nothing.  Even if countries decided to do this immediately it's not going to have an impact for 100 years.  The temperature will still rise by at a minimum of 2 degrees by the end of the century and quite possibly by much more.

Small scale changes are like shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, when what we really need to do is build a submarine.  Personally I think we should be building underground cities and biosphere like structures that can grow food and mine aquifers for water.   We already have this technology.  It will likely be possible to fix the environment eventually, but humanity is going to have to ride out the changes for a few centuries in order to get there. 

We already have two examples of runaway greenhouse effects in out own solar system, Mars and Venus:

http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/06/-venus-and-mars-hold-priceless-climate-change-warnings-for-earth-todays-most-popular.html

We know what happens when the atmosphere of a planet warms up.  These runaway effects happened without the influence of humans on the atmosphere at all.  They likely happened over millions of years.  What we have done as a species is compressed the release of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses into a century what would have taken millions of years to release naturally.  That's not going to be fixed by biking to work.  I applaud the effort, and I don't mean it to be personally insulting, but if humanity is going to survive this, we need to apply our efforts to mitigation and not prevention.

641,cw0e96p,"I think Chris Harman does a fairly good job of trying together a lot of different theories to provide a suitable explanation in his work 'A People's History of the World'. Essentially, he argues that it was internal pressures and dynamics which weakened various civilisations and left them prone to a variety of external threats such as slight climate changes and foreign invasion. He actually takes a broader view than most, arguing that the Bronze Age Collapse is actually part of a larger trend he terms 'crises of early civilisation', pulling Mesoamerican and Indus cities into the mix, across a much longer period of time.

The gist of his argument is heavily indebted to Vere Gordon Childe and argues essentially that the various ruling strata of these early civilisation grew ever more exploitative and consumed greater portions of economic surplus. He points to the work of Kemp (Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period) in detailing the growing consumption by the Egyptian court system and strain on agricultural resources as a chief piece of evidence. This in turn drove down living standards of the working population to the point where, despite some advances in bronze working, many craftsmen and farmers laboured instead with primitive neolithic tools and older techniques were used as last resort (e.g. plucking wool, per What Happened in History and Lloyd's Ancient Egypt: A Social History).

Related to this is a dynamic which Childe explains, claiming that early civilisations went through a lengthy period of stagnation during their 'peak'. While great monuments and other signs of civilisation certainly seem grand, advancement in science and technology was miniscule compared to the leaps of the early agricultural societies. What advances did occur, such as in pure mathematics and water wheels, were largely by peoples on the periphery of these large civilisations (Man Makes Himself). The theory provided is that the ruling castes, having turned to a strategy of intensifying work for labouring classes, had little need for investing time or resources into labour saving technologies. Bruce Trigger, for example, details the cease in advances made by Egypt during the Old Kingdom period as scribes and bureaucrats came to dominate surplus consumption (The Rise of Egyptian Civilization). 

These weakened civilisation were hence more susceptible to those factors mentioned here by others, such as invasion and climate change. Harman also adds intensified social strife to this list of factors, using Mayan peasant revolts as a key example. Egypt and Mesopotamia are highlighted as odd examples where changes in the ruling layers of society and some development in trading meant that civilisation went through a period of turmoil, but then largely got back on track for several centuries more until the collapse came again, as the underlying dynamic had not changed. 

Although some of this work is getting a bit long in the tooth now, and certain archaeological evidence has been disputed, to my knowledge no one has ever really overhauled any of Childe's or Harman's basic approach or overarching theories.",,
642,d6999dw,"Climate change is mainly caused by the [high emissions of greenhouse gases](http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/). Another thing that is affecting this, is also the rate of deforestation around the world. So there is not enough vegetation to absorb these gases and the problem is worse. The seas are also an important factor absorbing greenhouse gases (algae) and that's why the oil spills and generall pollution there is in the sea is so damaging, not only for the specific place it affected, but globally.

There a many reasons of the high quantity of extinctions. One of them is climate change, other is habitat loss due to human activities: cattle, agriculture, expansion of cities, mining, water/air pollution, high exploitation of a certain resource needed for a species, all that exotic pets market, etc. Most of our economic practices are pretty agressive on the environment and either affect the species directly or their habitat.",,

My news is usually BBC or  PBS newshour. I prefer minimalist partisan spin, and just the facts. I dont mind a piece that is meant for me to generate empathy for humans living in very bad living conditions.

And I believe our media should be held to a high standard. If an outlet repeatedly misinforms the public, misrepresents the facts, or repeatedly violates journalistic ethics in how it conducts spreading its media, if it were up to me that media outlet would be shutdown.

This would help reduce the spread of partisan propaganda in societies.",,
653,depk8tg,"&gt;the author isn't even qualified to be writing on climate, his doctorate is in evolutionary biology.

You think a doctorate in evolutionary biology, does not qualifies a person to write about climate science? If that is so, your view of what is the climate is extremely narrow. Biological system are major drivers and indicators of the planet's climate. 

Further more another field of study of the author is ""organization theory (autopoiesis, hierarchy, emergence, complexity, knowledge)"". The complex interaction of all the systems in the climate makes this field more relevant to climate change than meteorology, paleontology or many other more practical fields.

His background on ""Organizational knowledge management (engineering, defence, communities of practice, community groups, documentation and content management, product life cycle management)"" gives this person a a unique perspective on how changes in the climate will actually affect our livelihood.

671,f9lft0a,"&gt;but I do have to wonder what it says about us that a teenager can gain traction on this topic but adults apparently can't, despite talking about it for decades longer than she's been alive.

Because Greta represents *us* the generation who will bear the brunt of climate change. Greta also speaks the truth in an unfiltered way. Again, something that is a direct mirror of how millenials and younger speak and think of climate change. She is not some celebrity advocate who goes to some fundraisers and then goes back to her cushy carbon-filthy lifestyle like, say, DiCaprio or Gore. And unlike scientists who try to keep a level head, speak factually and impassionately, she speaks from the heart. We feel her anger. The reason why Greta resonated where adults failed is very very easy to understand if you bear in mind that her supporters and the people she inspired are millenials and  Gen Z.

&gt; I reserve judgement about her long-term effectiveness, but right now I'm not seeing any concrete changes being made, let alone as a result of Greta personally.

Greta has no power herself. She is just a girl. She has however been the catalyst of massive youth-led protests all over the world the likes of which have never been seen before. The fact that politicians do not care, just shows how broken beyond repair the systems of political accountability are, it has no say about Greta's work. She is the world's greatest and most impactful climate advocate. But fixing climate change is an issue that goes beyond policy within a country, it requires leaders of every country to sit down with a willingness to make radical changes, including the US, China, India, Australia and other developing countries - all these are actors with a vested interest in NOT doing the things necessary to cutback emissions because their economies depend on these bad practices. Climate change will never be fixed because the short-term effect are going to be disastrous for many countries and therefore cost a lot of political capital for decades and years to come.

680,c0jsinj,"&gt;That has been incredibly informative and insightful. I greatly appreciate it. I couldn't say much about the operation that went on at my grandmothers farm. I was a bit too young to really ask those kinds of questions.

Thanks -- I'm glad I'm making at least a bit of sense. I've been spending quite a bit of time researching this subject lately.

&gt;I only take issue with this last statement. I think since we have domesticated many of these animals to the point that they can no longer survive without us, it is now our moral imperative to ensure their survival.

We're obligated to care for animals that already exist, but we're under no ethical obligation to tend to a breed/species that we created if we discover that the breed/species is harmful to the planet. In fact, ethically, it's quite the opposite. For instance, in order to prevent further harm to many animals(through climate change, food and water crises, etc.), we would be much better off without large domesticated land mammals. A species doesn't know nor care when it goes extinct. Extinction only matters when other beings relied on the extinct species for survival -- and no one relies on cows or sheep for survival.

&gt;They may not be necessary in some parts of farming, but they cannot go ignored since they have many uses when it comes to agriculture, and they have high cultural importance in many countries.

Animals are unnecessary to grow food. Look up vegan organic farming and perhaps seek out the book Growing Green. The largest CSA (community supported agriculture) in the US is a farm in New Jersey with nearly 5,000 subscribers. They use no animal inputs at all.

&gt;Manure may not be necessary, but it is a great option, and in a world undergoing incredibly fast transformation, more options is what is needed, because the best solution cannot always be distributed worldwide.

That's true, but I'm arguing for the *best* option for people who have the ability to choose it. Showing that other people may not be able to do it simply goes back to my point about making up for what other people can't or won't do. My point is that giving up animal products is *easy* and any environmentalist who thinks they're doing the best they can without becoming (at least close to) vegan is kidding themselves.",,

685,c40ix15,"I used to be a science teacher, and me being that mad scientist that I am, I did a few things that some people might consider cool.  My favourite one was a demonstration gone wrong with some white phosphorous.

White phosphorous spontaneously ignites at about 25 or so degrees and the climate at the time was about those temperatures.  So I tell my year 10 class that the phosphorous should ignite once it is out of the liquid.  -I lied.  Even after waving it around like a maniac I had no burning phosphorous.  So I tell the kids that it may have not ignited due to a dirty top layer and proceed to cut a fresh surface.  That was a mistake.  As soon as the scalpel started carting... WHOOSH!!!!  Smoke and flames everywhere...  I was enjoying myself and waving the phosphorous around and showing the kids how it burns and lets off white smoke.  About the time that the fire alarms start going off I decide I should put my serious face on and kill the reaction before evacuating while we wait for the fieries.  I wasn't popular with the Head of Science, but the kids were nervously excited coming into my class for the rest of term.

A couple of the other cool things I have done with students:
-Making butanoic acid (smells really bad) from butyl alcohol (smells bad) whilst using a student volunteer.  They learn about how a change in functional group can affect smells as well as demonstrating oxidation reactions...
-The glowing pickle experiment.  Sticking two nails into the pickle, and hooking the nails into the mains power and hitting go.  The outcome is rather cool, and can be seen on this youtube link: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP3TlGixCEo&amp;feature=player_embedded#!)
But I did learn that if you accidently touch the nails together in the pickle you get the nails welded together and sparks flying.
I have a few others that used to keep the kids interested in how I would try to burn the lab down each week.

The State of Texas and the County has primary responsibility for flood control.  When we're looking to respond to a disaster the first lesson we learn is what was done wrong, and if necessary how do we replace the people who failed to prepare us for the disaster.  Before we start implementing 'fixes' we need to get rid of the people who got us in this mess in the first place.  

Ed Emmett is at the top of my list.  In office since 2007, he has consistently denied climate change and advocated for tax cuts while wasting county revenues on things like his stupid Astrodome fetish.  He's clearly not interested in doing his job, so he should be fired.  Steve Raddick is #2, also a long-time Commisssioner, also has failed to act (and his precinct is the part of the County that received the worst flooding - so that was a big ""fuck you"" to his voters).  If this were Japan he would've committed ritual suicide for failing so badly, but in American you fail up.  Either way, we need to purge current officials from office.  They're not competent and/or they are corrupt to the point that they can't serve the public's most basic interests.  I'm not advocating for any particular party - just saying, throw the bums out.  

Maximize the capacity of the draining system.  Despite what some reactionaries will tell you, three 500+ year storms in three years is not ""a once in a lifetime event.""  It's indicative of a massive shift in the kind of weather patterns we can expect in the Houston area.  We need to make sure that the drainage system is up to the task.  The Corps of Engineers is already engaged in a project to widen the bayous, but a flood control tunnel is in order (at least one, ideally three to link each reservoir to the bay).  This will give overflow capacity so that the 'ordered release' flooding will be much less necessary in the future.  

Link the reservoirs.  The reservoirs should be directly connected to permit water to flow from one to the other.  Precipitation will very rarely be uniformly distributed over the watershed, so linking the reservoirs allows us to use the current storage system to be used as efficiently as possible.  

Longest term:  Meyerland has got to go.  It floods every single year and has for as long as I've lived in Houston.  Buildings in Meyerland are built with flood response infrastructure pre-emptively.  This is a sure sign that this is not a place that people should be living.  The County/State and Federal Government should develop a long term plan for future reservoir placement - this plan should include setting aside the billions (over decades, so really only tens of millions) necessary to purchase homes, condemn them, and build reservoir space.  The Meyerland area is far too flood prone to be populated.  If we make it clear that the 50-year plan is for it to become Lake Meyerland, the cost can be minimized and we can make ""installment payments"" on the project rather than borrowing a huge amount of money all at once.

I find it unlikely the poster was aiming to argue for the *actual* position of ""Fuck y'all, got mine', but rather arguing that this is a common position for people under pressure. I've myself made the argument (in real life, not on the internet) that we're liable to end up shooting refugees if climate change makes things bad enough. This doesn't mean I advocate shooting refugees (rather, swift and strong action on climate change), but I certainly understand that it could happen.",,

In my theory global warming arises from heating Earth crust and ocean water with dark matter pervading occasionally solar system  [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/8j3fex/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/9vug33/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_ii), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/bqnqnf/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_iii), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/dxui3r/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_iv/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/gkk2wp/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_v/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/jskvfb/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_vi/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics_AWT/comments/nj5uvt/geothermal_theory_of_global_warming_vii/). The carbon dioxide levels are thus only minor driver of climatic changes (rather consequence than cause) and global warming can (de)escalate much faster, than greenhouse model allows. The conservative circles were traditional dismissers of global warming in general, whereas progressivist scientists established itself as an ""alarmists"". 

But I soon realized, that problem of progressives can become exactly opposite: the escalation of global warming symptoms can be much faster and violent, than their own models predict. But the progressivist science reacts to observational paradoxes in its typical consumerist way: rather than thinking about more advanced explanations they're simply calling: give us more money. Under such a situation the further investments into research become [perverse incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive): we are rewarding scientists for doing biased and short-sighted work in essence. 

Not to say, that computer models are descriptively blind [GIGO i.e. ""garbage in, garbage out""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) approach, as they cannot invent more logics, than its inserted during their programming. As one meteorologist once said to me, more powerful computers just help you get the wrong answer faster. No computer model can invent dark matter effects or whatever else cause of global warming by itself. In this way formal models just contribute to perpetuation of blunders in science. Scientists have to work smarter, not [faster](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-13/essays/stupidity-of-computers/). See also:

It's understandable that you are feeling how you do, particularly if you are in an area that has been directly affected by climate change.

Self care helps me a lot when I am stressed/anxious about situations over which I have little control.  That can look like different things for different people.

Climate change. Increasing droughts/floods (depending on where you are), more wildfires, more hurricanes, more flooding in low-lying areas, and more temperature extremes (including heatwaves but also going the other direction) are not an issue? The resulting potential for political instability is not an issue? The earth's a big rock, it's going to survive just fine. The concern is around keeping it habitable (i.e. so humanity can survive long-term). Effects are worst (already being felt) at the equator, it's just taking longer for the US to start feeling it. There's a reason the UN makes a big deal of this. (And this comes from someone who kinda hates environmental hippy groups for not understanding the science behind things, and misleading people as a result.)

That's true, trucks are great for hauling dirt (and couches, because height isn't an issue and they can stick out the back). But on the contrary, if you're carrying luggage for a vacation and it's raining, either your stuff gets soaked or you put it in the cramped cab. Meanwhile, the trunk of my wagon is fairly sizable for this stuff, and I can lock it. When I carry bikes, I throw down a few ratty blankets. You gain a few things but you also loose a few things. I question how many truck owners actually use those capabilities (i.e. there's like one time a year a truck comes in handy for me... so I borrow one then).",,
732,do4lte2,"&gt; Why is the debate over whether or not something is a problem so terrible?

It isn't; that's how all solutions start. You first identify a problem, then you settle on a solution, then you implement the solution, then you measure its success. The problem is that *we cannot get past the first step.* We are stuck in an endless, meaningless debate (that isn't really a debate so much as a deliberate attempt to stall progress) that prevents us from moving on to the rest of the process.

&gt;  You're approaching it from the same angle as the other guy: ""Listen, our side knows better what the real issues are in our society, so if you would just accept that we could move forward!""

But we *really do.* We really, *really* do. Many of us have dedicated our lives (or large portions of them) to identifying these problems.

The fact that you believe that the debate is still justified is evidence that the tactic has worked. You've been convinced that more debate is required. Meanwhile, every day that passes makes the problem even harder to address.

&gt; I'm not a conservative, but I do understand many of their views.

We all understand conservative views. No one is confused as to what conservatives believe. But those views are incorrect. They do not reflect reality.

&gt; And you want to decide for me what I should feel about different issues going on out there right now.

You're talking about society-wide issues. Of course we want to decide for a segment of the population. We will never get unanimous agreement about what the issues are; that's impossible. Some small proportion of the population will always feel like they're being ignored (and they may be right).

&gt; Trans people are mentally ill and need professional help.

They are not, and your belief is not supported by the professional community.

&gt; Continuing to force acceptance of mental illness as ""normal"" is absurd.

""Normal"" isn't really a meaningful term in this context. Given your behavior in this thread, how many professionals do you think would describe *your* mental state as healthy?

You aren't really in a place to be throwing stones, here. You have an actual problem.

&gt;  They need help, and we should be focusing our efforts on making professional help available.

They need support. They do not need a ""cure"".

&gt; I feel that homosexuality is another mental illness.

You are incorrect, again.

&gt;  Now I don't care if they want to marry, but don't force me to be a part of that shit.

The way that you phrased this is telling. You are using the label ""mental illness"" not because you believe that the issue in question is a malady harmful to the person who holds it, but ***because you are personally disgusted by it.*** It revolts you. ""Mental illness"" is merely the most socially-acceptable (and even then, not by much) label you can apply while still objecting to it.

&gt;  If a private business elects to decline service (wedding cakes, for example) they should have every right to do so without being threatened, brigaded, and driven out of business by the hate brigade of the left.

""Hate brigade of the left"" is a really, really misguided term.

&gt; I'm sure you feel differently about both of these subjects

I do. So does the majority of the country, and so does nearly every medical and mental health professional. Your opinion isn't held by ***anyone*** in a position of topical knowledge. You hold it for no other reason than that you were raised in a way that has instilled in you a deep-seated disgust towards gay and trans people.

I'll repeat: You hold your beliefs about transsexual and gay people for ***literally no other reason*** than that you were raised to be revolted by them.

You were failed by your upbringing, and your current beliefs are the end result. You are furious at the world, because you were never taught how to deal with its pressures in a healthy way. Instead of looking inward, and figuring out what in your own life is causing you to be so toxic towards others, you externalize all of your anger. In your mind, ***literally the entire rest of the world is the problem.***

&gt; I'm not here to debate these issues specifically.

Your stance on these issues - and your behavior in this thread - paints a clear picture of the sort of person you are. No one is here to debate those issues. We've had those debates, and they're over. Society has moved past your backwards views on gay people. (Which, I'm sure, has only further served to increase your frustration and bitterness towards the world around you, as the spaces you feel comfortable in shrink day by day.)

&gt; All I'm saying is that it's fucked up that you and the other guy want to decide for me how I should feel about these topics and many others.

We don't really care how you feel. We're way past believing that it's worthwhile to try and change your feelings. If a lifetime of exposure to the rest of the world hasn't fixed you, we can't. What we *do* care about is whether you're in the way.

Right now, you're in the way.

&gt; There is literally no hope left for humanity. We deserve the extinction that climate change is bringing.

The same social circles that instilled in you a disgust for gay people are the social circles responsible for inaction on climate change.",,

""Social and environmental considerations point to the limited benefits of unfettered sprawl. In this sense, sprawl can be seen as a classic case of the tragedy of the commons. If all who have the necessary means were to contribute to urban sprawl, everyone would lose. Those left behind in deteriorating cities, in central or run-down peripheral neighbourhoods, are even farther away from the recreation and leisure afforded by the green spaces in outlying urban areas, and resources that could be used to improve urban infrastructure are diverted to building highways and providing services in newly occupied remote areas. The sprawlers themselves commute greater distances (producing more pollution, limiting interaction with families and reducing options for leisure time), increase the costs of providing infrastructure and services and ultimately destory the green space they sought, reducing it to the limits of their (admittedly larger) lots. And the environment itself suffers from loss of biodiversity, from compromising watershed protection and from accelerating climate change (through CO2 emissions and paved-over or built-up areas)."" All claims are being substantiated and lengthly discussed with counterpoints and criticism. Please inform yourself at some minimal level before taking such bets. Any google search with the keywords ""suburban"" and ""sustainability"" will do.

Al Gore didn't propose the idea of AGW. AL Gore didn't find the evidence for AGW. Al Gore did not find the evidence and develop the models to indicate that dramatic and dangerous changes are likely.

Yep, claiming that it's going to kill us all probably wouldn't be very scientific; and climate scientists don't make that claim.

When Chicken Little tells you the sky is falling, you have reason to be sceptical; but when climate scientists can show you strong evidence that the bit of space between you and the sky is getting an awful lot hotter, it's a good idea to listen (or at the very least, read what they have to say).",,

Do you think it's OK to tell everyone that there's nothing wrong and they should stay in a theater even when you know it to be on fire? If people then die because they didn't evacuate, are you at fault? Should that be an illegal act? Does it raise to the level of reckless endangerment?

If you agree with the above (I suspect many people will) then the question at hand becomes whether climate change presents the same sort of immediate danger to life and limb that a structure fire presents to the inhabitants of the building. I'm personally on the fence about that, but I think there's a compelling case to be made at least.

The long-term trends in the production of all of these pollutants was up, and it wasn't obvious how the production of these pollutants would change in the future. If you had given a climate scientist of the time a scenario - ""what happens if greenhouse gas production expands x10 while SO2 production is eliminated?"" - the climate scientist could have told you that that implied global warming, but it also seemed plausible at the time that SO2 emissions might grow fast while greenhouse gas emissions grew slowly or even declined, and if you'd asked a climate scientist then or now what the effect of that would be, they'd say ""well, that depends, you need to give me more precise numbers than that.""

&gt;According to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8° Celsius (1.4° Fahrenheit) since 1880.

This is probably where you stopped continue reading or stopped playing around with the funny temperature modell they put up for people like you.

&gt;Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15-0.20°C per decade.

Consistent to what I claimed

&gt;A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.

And for your inability to understand most basic concepts

&gt;As the maps show, global warming doesn’t mean temperatures rose everywhere at every time by one degree. Temperatures in a given year or decade might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. Exceptionally cold winters in one region might be followed by exceptionally warm summers. Or a cold winter in one area might be balanced by an extremely warm winter in another part of the globe.

&gt; Past precedent suggests that if a “populist era” takes hold, it might last as long as three decades. 

&gt; But why should cycles in modern history last for roughly 30 years? One possible explanation is that the successful ideologies and the political movements they spawn go through a cycle of emulation followed by overshoot.

&gt;If new movements or politicians develop an aura of success, they find imitators around the world. That sense of ideological momentum then creates a demand for the original ideas behind the movement to be pushed further and faster. And that leads to the over-reach phase of the cycle. An example of ideological over-reach is the way in which the Reaganite demand for lower taxes and less red tape eventually led to the excessive deregulation of finance, culminating in the financial crisis.

&gt;The fact that populist and nationalist parties around the world are already taking their cue from Mr Trump suggests that the cycle of emulation is already well under way. It is now standard practice for politicians, such as Viktor Orban in Hungary, as well as Messrs Salvini and Bolsonaro, to imitate the Trump playbook — condemning “globalism”, accusing the media of spreading fake news, mocking the “politically correct”, and scorning international organisations that attempt to deal with problems such as climate change or the resettlement of refugees.",,

You _ought to_ care equally about people no matter when they exist, whether today, next year, or in a couple billion years henceforth.

Many of the problems we face today, such as climate change, will have devastating consequences for future generations hundreds or thousands of years in the future. That should matter. We should be willing to make sacrifices for their wellbeing, just as we make sacrifices for those alive today by donating to charities that fight global poverty.

From 2007 to 2014, partly because there were tons of oil and gas profits begging to be used, partly because banks were - for a change - competing hard with each other to lend money, and partly because there were a lot of bargains to be had post-2008-crash, our businesses bought record levels of all three.

Since 2015, we've bought quite a bit less machinery, equipment and software, and a little bit less buildings and structures. (We can never really save on buildings and structures because the climate here is so much harder on them than in most other non-Scandinavian countries.)

The CD Howe Inst says the drop in machinery and equipment purchasing is a big red flag because that kind of purchasing is (usually, in developed countries, depending on context) an important forward indicator of GDP growth. Ragnaroksunset says you'd expect to see a long decline after a seven-year binge and is implying that CD Howe and similar economic commentators cry wolf too often because they take natural, cyclical spending changes and draw straight-line forecasts from whatever's going on right now.

In my opinion, both make fair points. We probably aren't going to see machinery and equipment spending heading back up until there's more certainty available about long-term borrowing costs. If we don't see that spending really bouncing up in three or four years' time though, CD Howe may have called it correctly, even if they jumped the gun a bit.

Good Excerpt from the article.

&gt; This in itself has become a major scandal, not least Dr Jones's refusal to release the basic data from which the CRU derives its hugely influential temperature record, which culminated last summer in his startling claim that much of the data from all over the world had simply got ""lost"". Most incriminating of all are the emails in which scientists are advised to delete large chunks of data, which, when this is done after receipt of a freedom of information request, is a criminal offence.

&gt;But the question which inevitably arises from this systematic refusal to release their data is – what is it that these scientists seem so anxious to hide? The second and most shocking revelation of the leaked documents is how they show the scientists trying to manipulate data through their tortuous computer programmes, always to point in only the one desired direction – to lower past temperatures and to ""adjust"" recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming. This comes up so often (not least in the documents relating to computer data in the Harry Read Me file) that it becomes the most disturbing single element of the entire story. This is what Mr McIntyre caught Dr Hansen doing with his GISS temperature record last year (after which Hansen was forced to revise his record), and two further shocking examples have now come to light from Australia and New Zealand.

The problem with social media for me is it encourages quantity over quality.  People overestimate the importance of the mundane things that happen to them.

In any case: No Facebook, no Twitter, no Instagram - nothing, and I don't ever feel like I'm missing anything.  Especially in this climate where people politically sloganeer at each other and then like and upvote (or like or share or whatever) the sloganeering.  I'd rather chew aluminum foil.

I remain surprised people consider it such a big deal or a big change to simply stop using it.  And the meltdowns I've seen people have as a result of it indicates how unhealthy it is for so many people.

I think when we're in the company of real live human beings we choose our words and we filter what comes out of our mouths.

789,c102b63,"Like I said, temperature is a lagging indicator of climate. Also, 1 degree per century, taken over a long enough time, is a devastating change. 

For some context, The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, a climate change event that caused an extinction event and drastically altered life on land and in the ocean, consisted of an 11 degree (F) change over 20000 years. That's .055 degrees per century. That was one of the most drastic warming events in the history of the earth. And now we are warming at one degree per century. Even if all the projections are off, and we are only going to continue increasing at one degree per century, that's *20 times* faster than the fastest climate has ever increased in earth's history. Unfortunately, most climate projections put our current warming as the base of an exponential increase over the next few decades. We only need it to go a few degrees either way to drastically change life on earth. Most organisms thrive in a relatively narrow band of temperatures, and a few degree difference one way or another can destroy entire ecosystems. For example:

The corals in the ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, all of that? That will be gone inside of 25 years. This is something that the coral do every time the water gets above a certain temperature. They've done it throughout the history of the earth, and they come back about 10,000 years later. Which is great for the coral, but pretty sad for us. And on top of being sad for us, all the fish and predators that rely on the coral as th base of their ecosystem will be gone as well. And so will all the fishing industries that rely on those ecosystems, and all the large economies of the world with fishing components will be severely impacted.

I do not have sources, for either the coral claim I just made, or the claim of increased storms. I am very sorry to not have these sources, but as I said, I am only answering your questions to the best of my ability as a college sophomore, I haven't done any independent research, and this stuff is from my History of the Earth professor.

We will continue to cross various tipping points that create irreversible changes to our current climate systems. Weather patterns will be disrupted everywhere, as regional climates change into something we no longer recognize. That mediterranean climate is now a desert (eh hem, California), the Amazon is now savannah, etc...this creates famine and water scarcity across the globe leading to war and mass death.  90% of all animals have gone extinct, the entire ocean is one big dead zone, only the most prolific plant species are left and they are colonizing new areas as older plant communities are lost...

In fact, it's so simply even you could devise a test.

2) Visible light has nothing for CO2 to absorb, so it pass right on through. Testable? Yes. Tested? Yes. Could anyone devise a test? Yes

3) When visible light strike an object, IR is generated. Testable? Yes. Tested? Yes. Could anyone devise a test? Yes

4) Green house gasses, such as CO2, absorb energy(heat) from IR. Testable? Yes. Tested? Yes. Could anyone devise a test? Yes

5) Humans produce more CO2(and other green house gasses) then can be absorbed through the cycle. Testable? Yes. Tested? Yes. Could anyone devise a test? Yes


Each one of those has been tested, a lot. You notice deniers don't actual address the facts of AGW? Don't have a test that shows those facts to be false?

You still don't get that study if you think your example is an analogy. 

Using your example:

If a meta study of police shooting studies shows that the vast majority of studies (97%) show rising shooting rates, then it's right to assume...wait for it...rate of shootings is in an up trend. 

Now if 32% of those same studies also analyze shootings per race and conclude African Americans are more likely to get shot, then that doesn't mean there is now a 32% certainty that this is the case...just that only 32% of the total studies analyzed even look at racial stats. 

Whether the racial stats findings are correct depends on whether the studies have been peer-reviewed and whether they're proper scientific studies using scientific method. If that's the case, you can make the claim that black citizens are more likely to be shot. 

**In short:**

97% of all climate studies analyzed conclude the globe is warming. That is an incredible amount of independent studies all coming to the same conclusion based on actual data. So yeah, the globe is warming.

Of all those studies, 32% looked at the root causes for the recent drastic change in temperatures and concluded humans are to blame...again, based on data. A lot of the overall studies didn't do that, they merely analyzed temperature trends, not the cause behind them. 

As for your silly little ""shitty blogger"" accusation...they link to scientific papers, so your accusation makes you look like a bit of a retard.

Also, more nests isn't necessarily a good sign. It could mean the overall population is recovering or it could also mean that there are just more females (probably some combination of the two but we currently can only estimate their numbers in the wild). Temperature and humidity of the nests heavily effects the sex of the hatchlings with more females being produced in warmer/drier conditions, and warmer/drier conditions mean overall lower nest viability.

&amp;#x200B;

 

# Parallel evolution

""Parallel evolution is the similar development of a trait in distinct species which are not not closely related, but share a similar original trait in response to similar evolutionary pressure.

Parallel vs. convergent evolution

Given a particular trait that occurs in each of two lineages descended from a specified ancestor, it is possible in theory to define parallel and convergent evolutionary trends strictly, and distinguish them clearly from one another.\[2\] However the criteria for defining convergent as opposed to parallel evolution often are unclear in practice, so that arbitrary diagnosis is common in some cases.

When two species are similar in a particular character, evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors shared that similarity; if they did not, the evolution of that character in those species is defined as convergent. However, this distinction is not clear-cut. For one thing, the stated conditions are partly a matter of degree; all organisms share more or less recent common ancestors. In evolutionary biology the question of how far back to look for similar ancestors, and how similar those ancestors need be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place, cannot always be resolved. Some scientists accordingly have argued that parallel evolution and convergent evolution are more or less indistinguishable.\[3\] Others insist that in practice we should not shy away from the gray area because many important distinctions between parallel and convergent evolution remain.\[4\]

When the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown, or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified, the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective. For instance, Richard Dawkins in The Blind Watchmaker describes the striking similarity between placental and marsupial forms as the outcome of convergent evolution, because mammals on their respective ancestral continents had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs. That period of separation would have permitted the accumulation of many relevant differences. Stephen Jay Gould differed; he described some of the same examples as having started from the common ancestor of all marsupials and placentals, and hence amounting to parallel evolution. And certainly, whenever similarities can be described in concept as having evolved from a common attribute deriving from a single remote ancestral line, that legitimately may be regarded as parallel evolution.

In contrast, where quite different structures clearly have been co-opted to a similar form and function, one must necessarily regard the evolution as convergent. For example, consider Mixotricha paradoxa, a eukaryotic microbe which has assembled a system of rows of apparent cilia and basal bodies closely resembling the system in ciliates. However, on inspection it turns out that in Mixotricha paradoxa, what appear to be cilia actually are smaller symbiont microorganisms; there is no question of parallel evolution in such a case. Again, the differently oriented tails of fish and whales derived at vastly different times from radically different ancestors and any similarity in the resultant descendants must therefore have evolved convergently; any case in which lineages do not evolve together at the same time in the same ecospace might be described as convergent evolution at some point in time.

The definition of a trait is crucial in deciding whether a change is seen as divergent, or as parallel or convergent. For example, the evolution of the sesamoid ""thumb"" of the giant panda certainly is not parallel to that of the thumbs of primates, particularly hominins, and it also differs morphologically from primate thumbs, but from some points of view it might be regarded as convergent in function and appearance.

Again, in the image above, note that since serine and threonine possess similar structures with an alcohol side chain, the example marked ""divergent"" would be termed ""parallel"" if the amino acids were grouped by similarity instead of being considered individually. As another example, if genes in two species independently become restricted to the same region of the animals through regulation by a certain transcription factor, this may be described as a case of parallel evolution - but examination of the actual DNA sequence will probably show only divergent changes in individual basepair positions, since a new transcription factor binding site can be added in a wide range of places within the gene with similar effect.

A similar situation occurs considering the homology of morphological structures. For example, many insects possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings is hardened into elytra, wing covers with little role in flight, while in flies the second pair of wings is condensed into small halteres used for balance. If the two pairs of wings are considered as interchangeable, homologous structures, this may be described as a parallel reduction in the number of wings, but otherwise the two changes are each divergent changes in one pair of wings.

Similar to convergent evolution, evolutionary relay describes how independent species acquire similar characteristics through their evolution in similar ecosystems, but not at the same time, such as (dorsal fins of sharks, cetaceans and ichthyosaurs). Examples

    Colouration that serves as a warning to predators and for mating displays has evolved in many different species.
    In the plant kingdom, the most familiar examples of parallel evolution are the forms of leaves, where very similar patterns have appeared again and again in separate genera and families.
    In Arabidopsis thaliana it has been suggested that populations adapt to local climate through parallel evolution [5]
    In butterflies, many close similarities are found in the patterns of wing colouration, both within and among families.
    Old and New world porcupines shared a common ancestor, both evolved strikingly similar quill structures; this is also an example of convergent evolution as similar structures evolved in hedgehogs, echidnas and tenrecs.
    Some extinct archosaurs evolved an upright posture and likely were warm-blooded. These two characteristics are also found in most mammals. Modern crocodiles have a four chambered heart and a crurotarsal, the latter being also a characteristic of therian mammals.
    The extinct pterosaurs and the birds both evolved wings as well as a distinct beak, but not from a recent common ancestor.
    Internal fertilization has evolved independently in sharks, some amphibians and amniotes.
    The patagium is a fleshy membrane that is found in gliding mammals such as flying lemurs, flying squirrels, sugar gliders and the extinct Volaticotherium. These mammals all acquired the patagium independently.
    Pyrotherians evolved a body plan similar to proboscideans.
    The extinct South American litoptern ungulate Thoatherium had legs that are difficult to distinguish from those of horses.
    The eye of the octopus has the same complicated structure as the human eye. As a result, it is often substituted in studies of the eye when using a human eye would be inappropriate. As the two species diverged at the time animals evolved into vertebrates and invertebrates this is extraordinary.
    Certain arboreal frog species, 'flying' frogs, in both Old World families and New World families have developed the ability of gliding flight. They have ""enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs, and reduced weight per snout-vent length"". [6]

Chamalet's character had some of the funniest lines in the movie and he executed them well. Actor of Bash CEO was outstanding. DiCaprio was amazing which did not surprise me at all. The news host and the astronaut were also great. Hill, Streep and Lawrence were decent but forgetable IMO.


The writing and editing in this movie was phenomenal. The Big Short was still more to my liking than this movie, but it's undeniable that McKay has a great way of inserting his own style in any movie. The movie has its hard-hitting moments too, some of the serious speeches were exceptionally written. Feels like the plot was predictable at some points though.The Pentagon chief that charged money was a great touch that exemplified everything I liked about it. 

The satire and some of the themes are definitely not subtle at all. Climate change and the pandemic are the super obvious allegory. I very much enjoyed how traditional and social media is portrayed in this movie though (the actor who called for less fighting made me laugh out loud too).

We see over and over again this is a basic problem of science, is that if a scientist has a theory and control over adjusting data, they will tend to adjust the data to fit the theory assuming that the data is wrong and the theory is right.

It is for this reason that blind studies occur in medicine, to factor out those biases. The names of the subjects and details of the subjects are obscured from the people with the theory. For global warming you would need an independent panel with no professional stake in the outcome of the measurements in charge of any such adjustments to the data. There is no separation, no blind in climatology now. All of the people involved have professional stake in the outcome of global warming.

The basic reasons for this are (1) the more severe your problem is, the more likely you get funding, (2) severe problems receive more public attention and fame, and (3) many scientists have gone on record and stand to lose face if they are proven wrong.

&gt;This one's a fun one because I think you're forgetting that someone that claims to be trans goes by their current gender and not the gender they were born with which can fuck up medical treatments and kill them. If a trans person refuses to say what their original birth gender is, a doctor should have every right to not treat them because they don't want to literally kill them, but maybe that's just me caring about other people's lives more than they care about their own.

Right, but not only does it allow medical professionals to deny treatment to trans people, but [anyone they perceive as trans or gay.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/24/21234532/trump-administration-health-care-discriminate-lgbtq) I also do not think that denying treatment to a trans person is the solution to the problem you brought up (and it definitely is not the only solution), but that's just me.

&gt;As for the ""against gay marriage"": On the topic of same-sex marriage, Trump stated in June 2015 that he was ""for traditional marriage"" but in 2013 stated, ""I think I’m evolving, and I think I’m a very fair person, but I have been for traditional marriage."" So he changed his mind, he grew as a person, but for some reason you're all holding him to his past words. Should we do the same for Biden and demand he be voted out for being a racist even now?

You're ignoring the fact that Trump supported the FADA, an act that allowed discrimination against LGBTQ folk on the basis of freedom of religion. You may think that this is a good thing because it protects religious freedom, but that kind of thinking was also used by critics of the civil rights act back in the 60s, when people believed that religious freedom should allow discrimination of race. Should we bring back segregation as well? Because that is what we would essentially be doing by passing that law, only it's against LGBTQ people and not colored people.

Also, (despite him definitely being a racist), Biden himself has not passed any legislature (at least, during his presidency) that is harmful specifically to minority communitites that other presidents have not done already. In fact, he has done many great things for minorities, such as passing laws that help prevent asian hate crime and funding minority dominated businesses and colleges. While he has one some more than questionable things in the past, his current actions are pretty benign (at least here in the US). That said, I completely agree with you that Harris was a mistake, and that is putting it nicely.

&gt;Well, gee, those numbers sure look different. And the second set is from Bush Jr.'s time. Want me to look up Obama's Because I can and it'll show you that it's not trickle down economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;The math at the highest level is $130,900 taxed under Bush Jr. and $83,059 under Trump. But feel free to do the actual math at the lowest level. Here's a hint, you pay more taxes under Bush Jr. with the 15% to your $19,050 than the 10% under Trump for the same amount. So, not sure where you're getting ""trickle down"" from as all tax rates were reduced and value ranges were increased under Trump.

Individual tax cuts were not the only change caused by this bill (I also would like to point out that the individual tax cuts expire in 2025.) [It also dropped the corporate tax rate, giving huge gains to the wealthy and big businesses.](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/) A quote from Trump, “Under my plan, I’ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan. It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.”

&gt;Oh, where to begin with this pile of stupid. He said the level the Democrats were playing up to was a hoax, not that the thing itself was a hoax. As for ""encouraging his supporters to not wear a mask"", that kind of counters your ""Trump was pretty pro ""do-what-you-want"""" later on in your post, doesn't it?

After a quick fact check, I see he never actually called it a hoax, and that is my bad. However, mocking Biden during the debate for wearing a mask, mishandling the pandemic, disregarding medical professionals, and catching covid himself and *still* playing it off like it is no threat, I think it is safe to say that the way he handled this pandemic was horrid. As to how him encouraging his followers to not wear a mask is contrary to what I said, he said that wearing a mask wasn't necessary and that medical professionals telling people to do so was against freedom. IE he was telling people to do what they want, even if it threatened other peoples lives.

&gt;For global warming, I've heard the same crap for at least 20 years about the world ending in 10 years. This same shpiel has been repeated since the 1970s. Either we're going to die in the next 10 years when ""scientists"", and I use that term loosely, say this, or we won't. I'm leaning toward ""not"".

So, because some science man said that we're gonna die in 10 years was wrong, that means that climate change is a hoax and we should just ignore it and keep destroying the environment, despite it [having very visible consequences on us already?](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/)

I also feel the need to say that most scientists believe that our ability to do anything about the climate crisis will be out of our reach and will start seriously affecting us in a decade or two, not that *""The world is gonna catch on fire in 10 years and were all gonna die!!!""*

&gt;Doesn't him telling people to do what they want contrary to you saying he encouraged his followers to not wear masks? So which is it? Did he let them do what they want or did he want them to not wear masks? Also, not a whataboutism when it's literally what happened. I'm not saying ""Would you be saying the same thing if Pelosi was saysing what Trump said"". I'm saying that people like Pelosi and Schumer literally said ""come on down to Chinatown here in NYC, it's safe"", but you don't want to acknowledge that because it goes against your narrative.

I already addressed this first point, and what you're doing is literally whataboutism.

&gt;Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.

Whataboutism isn't when you point to a hypothetical situation and ask what I would think if someone who (you assume) I support would do something I do not like. You're taking my point about Trump underplaying the pandemic and pointing to Dems that also did the same thing. That is whataboutism.",,

If you analyse mainstream right wing or conservative parties around the democratic world (discounting the European far-right parties), the GOP is particularly notable for its extremism. 

The party's extreme stances on guns, hostility to climate science and science in general, religious fundamentalism, glorification of cruelty and ignorance, the obsession with trickle down economics, catering to special interests, even an embrace of white nationalism, make it an outlier amongst conservative parties in the democratic world. 

You cannot honestly compare Angela Merkel's party and the Republican party and say they are the same, even though both parties are made up of self-described conservatives. Look at the Tories in UK, they keep winning elections and are taking actions to mitigate climate change.

Look I am left of centre liberal myself and am not a fan of conservatism. However, it would be intellectually dishonest to write off the entire movement based on the American example. Yes, the Republican party deserves to be destroyed and burnt down to the ground. But they are ideologically the most extreme mainstream right wing party in the democratic world and are not at all representative of other conservative parties. That's not to say there aren't bad mainstream right wing parties in other countries too, however they are STILL nowhere near as extreme as the GOP are.",,
884,eh6gwjd,"Well said.  I think it’s more complicated than that and we could point to a confluence of factors: the rise of postmodernism leading to a destruction of national pride across the west, a sense of utopian individualism, the comstamtly re-opened wounds that all the redefinition and other language/race games postmodernism thrusts to the forefront of debate, it all takes up such a significant portion of any meaningful public debate. 

Since most of the arguments are not meaningful or productive, this becomes a greater and greater problem as we are now beginning to see the harshest ramifications from the expectation of infinite growth take hold.  

Corporations have one legal obligation and that is making a profit for their shareholders.  However, investors tend to be finicky and every quarter when the reports come out they tend to make rash decisions when they don’t see growth.  So companies are under ever increasing pressure to maximize profits and growth at every quarterly report.  

This is completely unsustainable and some of the actions being taken are like a set of Russian Dolls of collapse.  Imagine a business taking the money they save with the new tax plan, which is always sold to us as something to create jobs and encourage innovation, then putting it towards R&amp;D to create AI programs and robotics to replace the costs of labor.  

Now think about the fact that every single corporation in the world is spending loads trying to innovate robots and give them the jobs, without thinking about just who the hell is supposed to BUY their product after a large portion of the lower-middle class has been replaced by technology.  

If they are that shortsighted about the fact they are essentially  committing suicide to keep up this ridiculous mandate placed on them by the fear of speculator investors driving stock price down, and also wield much, much more power than one would think because of their advertising deals and shared board memberships on media groups as well as their lobbying power and multinational ties which make corporations the main drivers of trade treaties and agreements - then think about their attitude towards climate change or socioeconomic collapse, etc...

Their attitude is most likely, “well, if it’s gonna happen it’s gonna happen” and they buy bunkers and stock them and then go back to their economic shell game while pissing in the stream we drink in.  

Meanwhile it’s hard not to say we’re complicit, as so many have taken up the nonsense fights pushed forth bu our neoMarxist college professors who push postmodern, masturbatory hypotheses as absolute fact, and so many have taken to social media posts as a means for justice which has good intentions but in the end will only make you bitter, angry and boxed in thinking no one but your bubble is tolerant or of worth.  

We’ve completely whooshed on the true battle in American Politics today, a theme throughout the west.  We see red/conservative/republican/racist vs. blue/liberal/democrat/tolerant and draw battle lines from there when it’s:

A. globalism and the multinational corporations’ goals to destroy borders to intensify competition in the labor market as a means to drive wages down, save on shipping costs and tariffs and move goods more quickly and smoothly and increase market penetration into new countries.  

This is exploitative and fuels their desire for profit at all cost.  Yet they sell it to us as hands across American, benevolence, tolerance, and paint anyone who dare make the logical argument against as xenophobic, racist, fascist, etc...

versus

B. Nationalism and realizing at some point, if your priorities don’t lie with the land you stand on and you’d rather hinge everything on a ridiculous utopian concept that a country should just let anything and everyone across and give them entitlements, not expect them to learn English when most people who say that aren’t gonna learn their language, along with everything else that is designed to provoke hate and irrationally to further erode the west to get one step closer to the global system of control that the power players of the world have desired on paper since 1992 - if that’s your prerogative, so be it, it’s just extremely idealistic for how nihilistic it is.  

At some point reason and acceptance of some consequence should enter the debate but those with the megaphone prevent that actively.  

There’s something to be said about stability and order.  These things aren’t at all something I cared for until my mid-30s, when I realized that holy shit - Christianity actually was the best, most effective tool for governing and the benevolent as well compared to the competition.  Nothing is perfect, but having the staples be encouraging honestly, forgiveness, leading by example, supressimg envy and resentment and overall being good to one another, it’s hard to argue against it.  

Now that postmodernism has taught us to deconstruct and treat biology as a mere construct of society, we’ve begun to hate the old guard and most won’t ever realize just how destructive that was.  Postmodernism says we can free ourselves from the restraints of the past while also saying that if you’re white you’re a racist because of what happened 200 years in the past.  It’s absolutely ridiculous and serves as the perfect vehicle for demoralization via education which has been a goal of our enemies for decades but when Trump/Russia gets brought up the media only says “Russian colluded with Trump”, even after the Senate report weeks ago stating no evidence was found of that, they still say it not because Trump is a piece of shit - he is — it’s becuase he’s not a globalist, he wants to put America first, he’s just really bad at everything he does and very good at getting poor people to guffaw at how rich, brilliant and self-made he is.  

The time and place for chasing utopia is never, yet that’s what has been encouraged and not many sit at home with a worthless social justice-gender studies degree or work in service with an education degree and still want to chase their interests without ever facing reality or questioning corporate news unless it doesn’t fit their worldview.  It’s insane.

912,i5s5y7s,"Well first off, we don’t hate cars. We hate car-dependent society. Aka a society that forces or encourages people to use cars, which is what we currently have in most of the US. But there’s a few reasons.

1). Car infrastructure and sprawling suburbs are bankrupting us. The cost to maintain roads and infrastructure to car-dependent suburbs is immense and is not recouped by the people living there. Us in the city are subsidizing rich suburbanites. Not to mention, businesses that are built around cars like malls, drive through places, and fast food all cost more and make less for the city than dense urban businesses like our old downtowns. And they’re less stable too. We are currently bleeding money on cars and we shouldn’t be.

2). They’re bad for the environment. Even electric cars aren’t great, although they’re better than gas cars. If we want to tackle climate change we need to move away from cars and towards walking, biking, and public transit. These are all significantly better for the environment, both globally and locally, then cars. Thousands of people die from poor air quality every year because of car emissions, even in the US.

3). They’re bad for us. Cars are incredibly unsafe, especially for pedestrians. Over a million people are killed by cars every year, and driving is one of the most dangerous things you’ll ever do. It’s stressful and scary and puts people in a bad mood, which makes crashes even more likely. The fact we drive everywhere rather than walking or biking is also terrible for us. There’s a reason the world is so fat today, and one of the main ones is the lack of exercise. I’d rather bike everywhere if I could, but I can’t because my city is so car centric and spread out. Ideally it’d be even faster than driving, like it is in some European cities. Lastly they’ve atomized out society. We lack the sense of community humans have had for thousands of years because we don’t see our neighbors anymore, we don’t pass them on the street, or run into them at the corner store. We’re all lonely and stuck in our little bubbles and isolated from each other. Is it any wonder people lack empathy nowadays?

There’s more reasons then just these, but if I listed them all my comment wouldn’t fit lol. If you want to learn more a great place to start is Not Just Bikes on YouTube. He has a playlist of videos about a group called “Strong Towns” that I highly recommend and basically spells out all the problems with car-centric development. It’s really interesting : )",,
913,hacp4ap,"Excerpt: 

&gt; But surviving isn’t the same as recovering. The losses from business disruption after a disaster often dwarf the losses in the event itself. We will need power, water and businesses up and running to chart our path to recovery. We have been making strides toward such resilience. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power began a major seismic resilience program in 2014 to protect our water supplies. Southern California Edison has established a seismic resiliency program, working to protect the electric grid.

&gt; But back to our buildings. Because we have considered decisions about the financial risk of earthquakes to be a matter of personal choice, our life safety building codes ask only that a building not kill its inhabitants. After a quake, the building that didn’t crush you may nonetheless be a total loss, built to meet the bare minimum of the codes to save every possible penny in construction. Models of a big earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault estimate that as many as 10% of the high-rises designed to the current code in downtown Los Angeles (30 miles from the fault) will be so compromised they will have to be torn down after the earthquake. Our physical lives will have been spared, but our economic lives could well be in tatters.

&gt; Assembly Bill 1329, currently making its way through the California Legislature, would change this outcome, and give us what most of us think, or at least hope, we are already getting from the building codes — homes and offices that can be repaired and returned to use. Our economy cannot recover after an earthquake if we do not have places to work or live. Ensuring that the way we build now won’t bake in trillions of dollars in future losses is, I believe, the most important step we can take to protect the economic future of California.

&gt; The need for “functional recovery” rather than merely “life safety” building codes has been recognized for some time. The 6.3 magnitude 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand, where buildings were constructed to the same standards and with much the same techniques as California, showed the problem. No one there died in a modern building, yet 1,800 structures had to be torn down. Christchurch recovered because more than 90% of its buildings were covered by earthquake insurance. We know from state insurance data that fewer than 20% of our buildings have that protection.

&gt; A recent report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Institute of Standards and Technology recommended that states with a high seismic risk should enact functional recovery building codes to protect the economy at the local, regional and national level. California, with the highest earthquake risk of all 50 states, should lead the way in resilience just as we have in combatting climate change. We did not wait for federal or global action on climate change, and we have seen the benefits in jobs, revenue and overall economic vibrancy.

&gt; We will save more money in the long run than we will have to spend up front because building stronger does not cost that much more — functional recovery standards are estimated to add only 1% to 2% in building costs, a fraction of the cost of rebuilding after a total loss. But until the code requires all projects to meet that standard, most builders won’t make the investment. After all, they sell the building and the future losses are someone else’s problem.",,

I think a lot of it is that Republicans have been viciously attacking anyone on the left for my entire adult life. Longer, really. I know I haven’t got a home there even if I wanted to go (which I don’t). 

I think a significant majority of Millennials know and care about at least one LGBTQ+ person. Most of us have student loan debt. Most of us have struggled to get into home ownership, or haven’t yet, and many of us will never have a hope of it. Many of us have had to delay parenthood, and many of us have no hope of being parents without condemning ourselves to eternal poverty. Most of us are concerned about climate change. Most of us don’t expect ever to be able to retire. Many of us, maybe most, are working more than one job. Most of us are underpaid. And in all of those categories - every single one - Republicans are against us. 

Our entire lives have been shaped by Republicans, either through negative actions, or through preventing positive Democratic actions via gridlock and bullshit. We’re not watching Fox News (average age of FN viewer is around 65), so we’re not getting brainwashed.

I lived in the Midwest for a number of years and pretty much every house has AC because it’s definitely worth the cost with how warm the summers consistently are.

A lot of folks do have portable AC units (I have 2 actually) but they are only so effective, especially if you have an entire house to cool off with multiple bedrooms. I think most newer houses probably have a heat pump installed during construction which is more efficient heating in the winter (which is more important here) and provides central AC, but most older homes (maybe even homes around 20 years old?) definitely didn’t have central AC installed when constructed. It really just wasn’t worth the cost or didn’t exist. So in order to have AC you have to pay to have it installed which isn’t cheap. The housing market is already really outrageous here so folks who rent definitely aren’t paying to have central AC put in.

When the government used deadly force to crush the dissent, protests demanding the president's resignation erupted nationwide.

&gt; IPCC report

I've read most of the last three IPCC reports. I've found them pretty solid on climate science (we can collapse the forcing function down to mostly one-dimensional, estimate a wide range of scenarios for this parameter (which comes out of the fast dynamics, so this is an *assumption*, but not an insane one), and get a pretty good idea of how the slow system responds). I've found them vastly less convincing on economic estimates. And they predict surprisingly small effect sizes (I could go see if I can find some of the quotes, but I recall single-digit percent GDP losses in hard hit areas) which are easily dwarfed by uncertainty. I've already quoted David Roberts ridiculing them on mitigation estimation. (""The latest such analysis is the 5th IPCC Assessment on Mitigation of Climate Change, which has people confidently asserting that properly addressing climate change will trim 0.06 percent a year off global GDP growth. Not 0.05 a year. Not 0.07. But 0.06."")

opinions don't have correct views

&gt;I feel comfortable saying that if you don't support these movements, you are morally wrong. That's not to say that the practical nature for addressing them isn't up for debate, but their implementation is not what the Republican platform is. Rather, Republicans:

I will concede this point. Morally i think it is wrong to have a denying view of global warming however republicans by nature are the people wary of change. This is by design that they act as the balance against rapid change that democrats like 

&gt;Opposed marriage equality and most other social movements. 

If you ask a republican what their opinion on gay marriage is most will be fine with it. Most people don't give a fuck. the people who do are religious republicans. Plus as backwards as it may sound now when gay marriage was being considered to be legalize could you say with exact certainly what the ramifications would be? 

&gt;Continually act to sell public lands and deregulate the fossil fuel industry.

while I too am opposed to fossil fuels I do understand the point that republicans make : people would lose jobs. Now we have stats saying it would make more jobs then before but in the renewable sector but republicans as the wary people they are were concerned that their was no guarantee that number would stay consistent unlike fossil fuel industry that was (from a perspective) consistent 

&gt;Literally don't even believe climate change exists.

yeah, i got nothing for this one I totally believe they are in the wrong but it's more wrong to try and silence them for it. like the poem goes :

First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

&gt;Effectively support the current system of healthcare as a market.

you have to understand that for most republicans the idea of paying someone elses medical bill is insane. Why do you have to pay when you never receive that benefit. Which bring us to the last point.

&gt;Reject most social programs using -- rather than academic or philosophical works -- propaganda about individualism.

most republicans are middle class and up. They don't see anything from the payments they make to social programs because why the fuck should they? Now how do I know that our current social systems are unfair? because I am an 18 years old white dude and have never owned a phone. My family has a rule that if you want a phone you pay for it yourself. Meanwhile my friend tony who is black and lives in easily the lower class has a government provided smartphone.

953,hbmecgl,"I really like Ezra Klein, but he has a few blind spots that really irk me, one of those being the darker side of this quote: veganism is not a political conversation.

It manifests in some really problematic ways. For instance, he had an episode about the climate crisis and never once did he ask his guests about animal ag, despite the fact that experts concur that we cannot solve the climate crisis without addressing that industry.

He's not wrong in his hesitations. Right after that quote he talked about how much the right lost their shit at the *lie* that Biden was going to limit their beef intake. That kind of response to veganism in the political discourse definitely has the potential to harm progress.

But there's a difference between pushing veganism onto people politically (enacting a law banning burgers, for example) and having veganism be part of the political conversation (it is one of the largest contributors to climate change).

If Trump had more than a pea-sized brain, he would listen to the USA's very own scientific institutions, which are unanimously calling for action on this, without anything to earn in doing so. For example: Nasa litteraly has nothing to gain in saying climate change is real and is a threat to our civilization. If anything, under the Trump presidency, they risk having their fundings cut. But they do what good scientists do: state the findings of their research factually.
People will say Nasa are fabricating/altering their raw data. They have officialy explained their reasons for altering said raw data if you are interested in learning why. Once again, ask yourself: why would they go through such lengths to prove Climate Change is real under the presidency of one of the biggest ""climate deniers"" of our time?

Finally I will say this: if you want to know the truth, the devil is in the detail. Look at official UN reports, reports from independant associations such as WPF, Greenpeace, official reports from various nations on the subject. Look at the frequency of wildfires in areas where they have been a known phenomenon in the past (ex: California). Look at the frequency of ski stations closing down in Europe (are they benefiting from this too?), and how year after year, you have to go higher up to find good snow (over the last 60 years). Look at the increase in heatwaves, etc.

Is this man-made? Is this just a passing phenomenon? We all have a choice to make here. But what is at stake is much more than a few hot summers. Most of the scientifc community worldwide seems to agree this is a phenomenon that arrises from anthropic activity. But hey, maybe they are all in the loop too. At the end of the day, the question you need to ask yourself, is how much are you willing to bet they are wrong.",,

And there are people who discovered that they can't (could never) count on their partners -- those people are also unhappy.

Also from here out, we're looking at a few years of an ongoing cold war (hopefully just a cold war) and recession (maybe depression). We're looking at values changing very rapidly.

Claim 1: Anthropogenic CO2 can't be changing climate, because CO2 is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources. Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas, so changes in CO2 are irrelevant.

Claim 2: The alleged ""hockey stick"" graph of temperatures over the past 1,600 years has been disproved. It doesn't even acknowledge the existence of a ""medieval warm period"" around 1000 A.D. that was hotter than today is. Therefore, global warming is a myth.

Claim 3: Global warming stopped a decade ago; the earth has been cooling since then.

Claim 4: The sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming. After all, Mars is warming up, too.

Claim 5: Climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data. Their so-called ""consensus"" on global warming is scientifically irrelevant because science isn't settled by popularity.

Claim 6: Climatologists have a vested interest in raising the alarm because it brings them money and prestige.

Claim 7: Technological fixes, such as inventing energy sources that don't produce CO2 or geoengineering the climate, would be more affordable, prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint.

It's also important to remember that imperial hostility and interference didn't start recently; Venezuela has rarely been free of it.

Venezuela still carries the marks of that colonial history, for example in its (racially correlated) unequal distribution of wealth (especially in land) and odious foreign debt.

Its popular/indigenous movements throughout the late 20th century, and especially since 1999, made progress in overcoming some of that, though. [Inequality](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SIPOVGINIVEN) has decreased and its [human development index](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/Country-Profiles/VEN.pdf)\* has increased, especially education and life expectancy, only starting to drop sharply with the latest sanctions.

Because it's impossible for a person to comment on this without bias or opinion, I'll give my opinions explicitly at the end and try to keep the explanation as objective as possible. Okay, let's walk through this instead of jumping head first at conclusions.

**What is BLM?**

Black Lives Matter is *not* an organization. There is no club, there is no meeting places, there are no real members besides loose identification. It's not even really a movement. It is an attempt to call attention to a problem. It started after George Zimmerman was exonerated for the death of Trayvon Martin. It's one of those things where the court ruled him not guilty, but public opinion is strongly divided. So on twitter, some users posted #BlackLivesMatter, implying that at the time, mainstream America does not believe that the lives of black people matter. This twitter tag further exploded with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 17 year old who was shot by a police officer. After this, BLM began to be used to call attention to a new problem: police brutality.

Now let's examine what is being argued for and against this.

**Criminal Record**

One of the more famous deaths that invoked the BLM hashtag is that of Freddie Gray. Freddie Gray was beaten badly during his arrest, and allegedly, while he was being taken back to the police station, he was left unbuckled and the driver swerved the car on purpose so that Freddie would be thrown around the back. This ended up with him bashing his head around, while already in a critical state, to the point where his bled out and died either before or soon after arriving at the police station.

Now there were two arguments here. One was that Freddie Gray is not a person deserving of any sympathy. He was a career criminal, and a threat to society. He had been in and out of prison, primarily on drug charges. The other argument is that it is completely irrelevant whether or not he had a rap sheet, the police were still out of line, and the constitution affords certain rights and protections to those accused of a crime.

That idea of him being a criminal and deserving death is very very important here. Those against BLM believe that they have picked very unsympathetic causes. Michael Brown was a criminal. Freddie Gray was a criminal. Alton Sterling was a criminal. There's a strong image of young black men being criminals as it is, and many believe BLM is furthering this image by calling attention to and protecting those criminals.

**Reverse Racism**

As I stated before, the intended meaning of the hashtag BLM is that it seems as though the media doesn't call attention to the deaths of black youth, thus devaluing their lives. Black lives matter and should thus their losses should not be dismissed.

As with any collection of words, its meaning can be interpreted in any number of ways regardless of original intention. One interpretation is that BLM makes the assertion that *only* black lives matter, and that others do not. Many simply do not believe the issue exists (this is one of the most important parts) and so by stating that black lives matter when, in the eyes of the opposition, they already do, they're reinforcing that above other races. This interpretation is that BLM is racist itself. This is where ""All Lives Matter"" comes from.

As with any trend, there is a spectrum. There are those who are so far into it, that they *are* actually racist against white people, and they have brought a disproportionate amount of attention upon themselves. This makes BLM even less sympathetic.

The counter argument to the interpretation is that there is an implied ""too"" at the end. ""Black lives matter too."" This is to reinforce the original intention that black lives don't matter more than any other race, but that they matter just as much as every other race.

**Disruptiveness**

As with any civil rights movement, you can't quietly sit at the sidelines and occasionally mention ""Hey um we have a problem"" and expect change. Part of fighting for civil rights is to cause a disruption that forces people to pay attention to your cause. A lot of people don't take kindly to how disruptive BLM protests have been, and some don't like fighting for civil rights at all. This is nothing new in history. From women's suffrage, to abolitionism, to gay rights, there are always people who strongly oppose any change or disruption at all. You'll often hear ""I get where they're coming from, but do they have to do it like this?""

**Defensiveness/Cognitive Dissonance**

Let's be real, people don't like to be wrong. People really don't like to be told that they're acting wrong. And people really *really* don't like to be told they're discriminating. Being labelled a racist or homophobe is not a good thing. Some people may actually be completely egalitarian but feel targeted by BLM. Others may be pretty prejudiced, and are opposed to facing that. They would prefer to ignore it. When people feel attacked, they get defensive and either become unsympathetic or outright go on the offense against that which they feel attacks them.

**Black on Black violence/Anti-police violence**

Some people feel that the black community is overstating the effect of police brutality, and believe it to be insignificant compared to other issues.

There's also been an increase in violence (or increase in coverage of violence) perpetrated against police, which further decreases sympathy for the twitter hashtag.

**Outright Racism**

Yep. It's still there. There are people who straight up dislike black people. They believe they are lesser or deserve their fate etc etc. People said Trayvon Martin was a thug for wearing a hoodie, and he was very sketchy looking. I've personally encountered no more than a handful of these people in my whole life, but they're certainly not an insignificant portion of the population.

--------------

So all of these reasons in combination make BLM so unsympathetic to some people that they ignore or oppose the hashtag, the problem is calls attention to, and the people who push it.

*Here's where I put in my personal opinion:*

**Criminal Record** - I despise the view of crime and punishment in this country. People believe that those who commit a crime are forever criminals, and that it is a core aspect of their persona, and thus they should be punished and removed from society. I find it abhorrent that people who are so patriotic have little regard for the Bill of Rights, which is intended to protect the accused (right to a trial, right to a lawyer, right to due process, so on and so forth). It doesn't matter Freddie Gray was a criminal, he was accused of something and should therefore be put through the justice system, which will decide what to do, and even that part is imperfect. It is not up to police officers, who often have little understanding of the law (which is why the law gives them a lot of protection, so they can't be sued for trying to do the good thing while not understanding legal nuance). I think attacking victims for being criminals defies what the Constitution stands for.

**Reverse Racism** - This is childish societal envy. It's like Nietzche's master and slave concept. When the slave tries to fight for their own equality, to not be oppressed, the master sees it as an attack on *them*. Everything was already the way it should be, it was already fair, giving the slave more rights means taking rights away from the master, such as the right to have a slave.

People also believe that pointing out one problem excludes the existence of others. Yes, there are societal conditions that make it harder for others than you. No, that does not mean that your problems don't exist. This is akin to saying ""climate change isn't real, we had a lot of snow this winter.""

I do dislike the aggression towards white people. There is even animosity towards white people who are trying to help, and that is just stupid. You don't convince someone to see your side by locking them out, though I do understand why some people might be weary.

**Disruptiveness** - On one hand, I think people have a fundamental misunderstanding of how change occurs. Being disruptive is absolutely necessary and should be encouraged to enact change. Meaningful social change can never happen with 100% peaceful sidewalk picketing.

On the other hand, I can see where opposers come from. Some of the demonstrations have been downright dangerous and asinine. Like lying down on a highway, blocking people from getting to the airport.

**Cognitive Dissonance** - Again, childishness. People don't like to face reality. Not much to say here without me just going off on a useless tirade that doesn't make an argument.

**Black on Black/Anti-police** - It is absolutely messed up that some people are attacking police in the name of BLM. That is diametrically opposed to the goal. We expect police to treat people better so that we can have a more trusting relationship. How can we have a trusting relationship if we're doing to them what they do to us?

I think people misunderstand ""black on black violence"" entirely. For one, it occurs at the same rate as white on white violence. Two, there *are* many people and programs speaking out against it. People also forget that it's possible to tackle multiple problems at once. You see this all the time. ""Why spend money on this when we still have homeless people?"" ""Why do you care about drug abuse when more people die from heart attacks?"" Well, because 9 women can't pop a baby out in one month. It doesn't work that way. We also already know the easiest way to curb violence: legalize drugs. It's simple, effective, and efficient.

The debate around climate change isnt really about changing climates its about how pollution effects the climate and to what extent.


Theres pretty solid evidence that fossil fuels increase the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. And we already know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas that can affect the environment. 1+1=2.


Thats enough for most people. But the problem is nobody really knows how *much* the added CO2 affects the climate. And some debate that its so minute that it makes no difference. And that blaming weather phenomenon on CC is no different then blaming it on Zeus. 

Computer models made by climatologists often try and show how climate is affected by greenhouse gases, but not everyone has faith in these models. Math is hard to understand, and this shit is a lot of math. And even with these computer models if you apply a margin of error then the world has had static temperature for centuries.


But most can agree that reducing fossil fuel usage is better for the local and global environment. And that being less dependent on a single energy source is a good thing. So having renewables and nuclear are good first steps into sustainability. (Until fusion replaces all energy needs)

&gt;Quiggin argued that the members of the 2004 panel, selected by Lomborg, were, ""generally towards the right and, to the extent that they had stated views, to be opponents of Kyoto."".[32] Sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of development economics, and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to them.[30] Commenting on the 2004 Copenhagen Consensus, climatologist and IPCC author Stephen Schneider criticised Lomborg for only inviting economists to participate:[36]

&gt;In order to achieve a true consensus, I think Lomborg would've had to invite ecologists, social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed, philosophers who could challenge the economic paradigm of ""one dollar, one vote"" implicit in cost–benefit analyses promoted by economists, and climate scientists who could easily show that Lomborg's claim that climate change will have only minimal effects is not sound science.

&gt;Lomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that ""Sachs disparaged the Consensus ‘dream team’ because it only consisted of economists. But that was the very point of the project. Economists have expertise in economic prioritization. It is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease,"" [33]

Sadly.. those 2 criteria are entirely subjective. How a person ""fits"" into the social dynamic of a particular team is going to depend entirely on the team and what type of person they are looking for. 

I work in a City-Gov.. and I've noticed quite a few different departments have stereotypical ""types"" of people they hire. (and those personality types wouldn't ""fit"" into a different department. 

Here's a few examples (sanitized because I don't wanna get name/shame): 

* Dept A is usually 50 to 60 yr old men. Gruff and ""old school"". Typically includes borderline offensive joking. Blue collar / cowboy types. Given a equally skilled range of candidates.. they're gonna pick someone like them over some fashion-forward gay college intern.

* Dept B is your typical ""lawyer type"" environment. Suits are worn every day. Jokes are ""HR safe"" and polite,  but relationships are often ""padded"" or built on who's drinking with who and whether or not you showed up to their rich house for Holiday Party or summer boating on the lake. Given a range of equally skilled candidates,.. these types of people are gonna hire someone like them. Blue collar Dept A (above) would likely describe them as ""dickheads"" or ""douchebags"". 

* Dept C is your typical ""green"" environmental/recycling group. They're touchy/feely and have pictures of kittens on their desks,etc,etc. They are middle class, have pot-luck fundraisers and cubicles are adorned with random crap. Given a range of equally qualified candidates.. they're gonna pick someone who believes the same things they do.. and not someone who brings fresh ideas or challenges their preconceived assumptions about climate-change or waste prevention. 

Expressing valid points or ""not being a dickhead"" is not enough to get you hired in most cases. You've got to apply to the right job... customize your resume to ""speak"" to the position being hired. .and then show you'll fit into THAT specific team (assuming you want to work for THAT specific team).

Sure, the idea of pure majority view and the popular vote deciding everything sounds like a dream but the system was structured like that by our founding fathers SPECIFICALLY to stop things like tyranny of the majority from occurring. Our system is much more complex by looking at individual states and districts and seeing how much depth there really is. However, one could argue that this has drastically changed due to the new makeup and clustering of people who share similar ideologies (coasts=liberals, mid-west=conservatives) but as has been argued, you have to deal with having uniformed people voting. 


Also, as I said in a different thread earlier, an increase in voting won't make much of a difference. There's been studies about non-voters and typically they're no different than voters besides the fact that they're usually more uniformed and politically ignorant than voters. By increasing the number of people who vote, it may sound good like you're getting more of an opinion but they really just cluster into the groups we have now. In the grand scheme of things, having everyone vote won't lead to a drastic political climate change. It might tip some congressional elections but rarely will it ever have a big impact like many people think it might. ",,

Climate change has really only been scientifically confirmed for a couple of decades. It takes time for opinions to change, mostly because an individual's opinions don't change much. But you can already see a huge shift in attitude toward climate change within the population at large.

Some parties are more concerned about it and have more radical solutions, but everyone's at least thinking about it. Companies are starting to be rewarded for being more green. They're voluntarily switching to more ecologically friendly materials and processes because this actually gives them an advantage in the market.

If you then took the time to dig deeper you would find this is an oganization which operates under the auspices of the U.N.

It has direct ties to the infamous Rio Summit held by the U.N. which gave birth to Agenda 21.

Ever heard of Agenda 21 ?

""We need to get some broad based support,
to capture the public's imagination...
So we have to offer up scary scenarios,
make simplified, dramatic statements
and make little mention of any doubts...
Each of us has to decide what the right balance
is between being effective and being honest.""
- Prof. Stephen Schneider, 
Stanford Professor of Climatology,
lead author of many IPCC reports

""Effective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound
reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world
has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both
governments and individuals and an unprecedented
redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift
will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences
of every human action be integrated into individual and
collective decision-making at every level."" 
- UN Agenda 21

Even if the theory of global warming is wrong,
we will be doing the right thing in terms of 
economic and environmental policy.""

industrialized civilizations collapse? 
Isn't it our responsiblity to bring that about?""

affluent middle class - involving high meat intake,
use of fossil fuels, appliances, air-conditioning,
and suburban housing - are not sustainable.""

1076,cdb9lha,"I disagree.  We can afford for everyone to have a basic standard of living that includes optional (IE non food, shelter, and air) goods if we simply work toward cleaner sources of energy.

Neither the US nor the rest of the world is ever going to voluntarily cut back on their lifestyle in a big enough way to stop anthropogenic climate change.  Rather, we have to find technologies and other ways to ensure the same lifestyle (and the future ways of living) for everyone that doesn't impact the planet that way.

In any case, even if the US cut its CO2 emissions by 99 percent, we'd still have global warming.  China is the problem.

They basically say that there is strong evidence but we need to invest *more* into research to accurately model outcome predictions. They also specifically acknowledge the rising concentration of greenhouse gases, which you claim have nothing to do with global warming and seem to be trying to gain false credibility by saying you're in agreement with the physics community when they seem to disagree. I would love to hear your response to this as this is the first time anyone has claimed to me that physicists universally disagree with climate change. That is certainly a new one.

Similarly, here is the statement made by the American Chemical Society:
https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/policy/publicpolicies/sustainability/globalclimatechange.html

There seems to be an agreement among chemists, even within the 1st world's leader in the science of ignoring climate change, that greenhouse gas emissions by humans is the leading cause of global warming, and reducing those emissions is paramount. (CO2 is the main greenhouse gas when GHG's are being referenced in case you aren't aware)

CO2 being present in the atmosphere and acting as a greenhouse gas isn't speculation, it's measurable reality. I don't know who told you otherwise, but they were poorly informed at best. There are two pretty great responses to a question of why CO2 isn't resting at the bottom of the atmosphere even though it's heavier than air.

1082,eywadjq,"A universal basic income spends less of its total funding as overhead, less than 1% when you just need to send out the checks. Also, recipients are universal, so it’s an equal entitlement, and the check can be spent on anything. This is very different from the state’s current welfare program which demands applicants perform many tasks like filling out paperwork, interviewing with bureaucrats, and releasing private information like whether you have drugs in your system or which jobs you’re applying to. After that, there are only certain things you can do with that welfare, like buy specific types of food or rent specific types of housing. A UBI maximizes freedom and fairness compared to welfare programs, which minimizes them.

Moving to a UBI is much more libertarian than the current welfare state. It reduces the power of government and instead empowers all citizens with the freedom to choose how best to use the protective service of the state. Citizens don’t have true freedom until they are guaranteed a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that’s only possible by cutting them a check for their basic needs. This is called [positive liberty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Concepts_of_Liberty).

Andrew also wants to sunset old laws and also wants to literally de-centralize the state by relocating federal agencies outside of Washington DC. He’ll end the drug war, legalize marijuana, and free non-violent drug users from prison and expunge their records. Also instead of spending an enormous amount on government environmental programs, his plan is to invest $3 trillion in cheap loans to homeowners to upgrade to residential clean energy themselves. This way American citizens will have the most freedom to use their own tax dollars to combat climate change and benefit directly from upgrades to their property. That’s much preferable to the alternatives right now. I didn’t even get into how Yang’s plans to massively cut military spending overseas and bring that money back home.

I just dont understand the correlation youre trying to make. Why are you telling me about Republicans and their policy ideas?

I think both major political parties are ill equipped to deal with this problem. I think boiling this down to a mere partisan issue, is so reductionist, it just unhelpful. I can only be further skeptical of your motivations if youre trying to make this a partisan issue.

One major component of the problem, is out lavishly wasteful lifestyles. Coal is ONLY burned, because we want more power for heat, cooling, gadgets, etc. Industry only creates and ship products that people go out and purchase.

Carbon taxes/credits, is just a tax on the poor and an attempt to **force** people to change their behaviors by stealing their resources. Poor people are the ones who will be most negatively impacted and the ones who often dont have the means to change. Its those with means who buy a new iPhone every year and throw their oold one Into a landfill, are the ones who most need to change and have the means to do so. A tax likely isnt going to change those types of people. There's also the fact taxes to change behavior, often doesnt work or has other adverse effects.

Yang's UBI system stands stronger on it's own, while most of what Sanders is proposing are good proposals intended to tackle symptoms of the disease instead of making a more fundamental impact. Strong unions make no sense when their core task of negotiating good working conditions can't start from a strong negotiating position. UBI gives them this strong negotiating position, as they get the ability to walk away from the table if there's no good offer coming. Medicare 4 all is a legit good idea, and Yang is also in favor of that, as indeed it's a necessity.

Student and medical debt however are problematic. I highly agree that costs of higher education have reached a point where they need to be addressed, but I don't think debt forgiveness by itself is enough. Education in private hands is education which has a profit incentive, instead of societal progress incentive. This doesn't mean that education has to be nationalized, but it does mean that government, as a stand-in for society, needs to regulate prices, curriculum and entree requirements. If you can run a private school under those circumstances and still run a profit, good for you, and there should be no impediment against doing so.

The green jobs programme is an interesting one. Mainly because Bernie's plan is a jobs plan, with a bit of a green afterthought. I'm personally really concerned about climate change, so I would have preferred to have seen it the other way around. This means employing the carbon tax/carbon dividend approach to give an incentive to provide greener alternatives, but also that nuclear shouldn't be a priori ruled out. In my opinion, a carbon tax will probably lead to more jobs, because for example bike couriers become more attractive than car couriers, but they're also slower so you'll need more of them. There'll be a shift from mining engineers towards nuclear engineers, etc. If you provide the right incentives, which a carbon tax high enough would do, the green jobs will automatically appear.

Why did you think this was a poignant statement to make? Why would you intentionally make the incorrect implication that only religious nuts are conservative? You are proving my point about shitty critical thinking and analytical skills. You came apparently wanting to debate some point but hobbled yourself out of the gate with that garbage thought. There were a ton of great points you could have made but went with the one that only scores points in liberal echo chambers. 

Yes, compassion is absolutely a second rate value. How about justice? How about equality? In many contexts, compassion is opposed to both. 

I personally debated liberals in threads about ISIS fighters not being allowed to return to the EU calling for compassion for them. They argued that literally every criminal should be given the chance of rehabilitation, even if the actual success rate of rehabilitation is piss poor. That conversation didn't even delve into distinguishing between different types of criminals (violent crime, financial crime, ""unintentional"" crimes like manslaughter), which would have added an entirely different dimension to discuss whether society should rehabilitate ALL criminals. That's how shallow that garbage level of analysis was. ALL criminals of ALL backgrounds and circumstances deserve a blanket chance at rehabilitation. Really? A good middle school debate team can pick that shit apart in 2 minutes. 




Liberals think conservatives are dumb (and believe things like majority of conservatives are religious ideologues) because liberal propaganda constructs an entirely different world based on complete bullshit, then calls anyone who doesn't accept that socially constructed view to be racist/sexist/revisionist/science conspiracy theorists/etc

That bullshit world isn't constructed to convince conservatives or centrists. It's constructed to guilt the various factions within the left to stay united, all while the core of the liberal platform marches ever further left. You have ""classical liberals"" who have debated against and otherwise opposed conservatives their entire lives being deemed as ""co-conspirators"" to the white supremacists.

The real idiots are not the people who refuse to take liberal ideology at face value (""the world is facing apocalyptic climate change within 10 years,"" predicted every 10 years for the last 60+ years), the idiots are the people who actually believe this shit. And yes, if someone has been crying wolf for 60 years and you aren't even starting to question their judgement or motives even a little bit, you're a fucking moron.

The thing is, we can't fight it when major countries choose not to help. there are only about 5 major countries in the world that consistently fight climate change, and that is a real shame. If all of the world's major countries helped, then i am almost certain we could fix this by 2040. also in case you are not aware, the switch to clean energy is gaining power exponentially due to the fact that it is now cheaper for factories and companies to use clean renewable energy then dirty fuels.

As an aside, to emphasize on your comment regarding how bad the pollution *still* is, that fact does not alone tell us that we or our government are being lazy.

*****
&gt; India has formally joined the Paris climate change agreement, handing over its country&amp;#039;s official ratification documents to the United Nations on Sunday.

&gt; The climate change plan was initially agreed upon by more than 180 countries at the Paris climate conference in 2015, but under its terms, it will not become binding until it is ratified by 55 countries that contribute a total of at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

&gt; The Paris agreement requires all countries who ratify it to come up with a national plan to limit global temperature rise, and as part of its plan India has set a goal of producing 40 percent of its electricity with non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

Climate change. Poverty. Diseases. We do not NEED to go to Mars. We NEED to fix those things i mentioned. I can warn you right now that using need to justify us going to mars is not going to work, cause we don't exactly NEED to go there.

&gt;Again stating something will take this or that long when the tech doesn’t exist is absurd.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can say it will be difficult but we don’t know how long would it take.

Saying that it won't take that long because of something that maybe is going to happen is way, way more absurd. In fact, my position is the opposite of that, it is boring and mundane. There is nothing absurd about it, it is just.. a drab. Generally arguments like that just do not work. YOU DON'T KNOW EITHER. But what we DO KNOW is that terraforming is really, really slow process. It won't be decades. If we make a breakthru we can maybe decrease that to round 1000 years. The next breakthru will maybe halve that. it is amazing that you even try to argue this but i can only assume that you have no clue how long terraforming takes in real life. In movies it is seconds with a ""biobomb"".. which in real life cause raging wildfires, category 10 hurricanes, horribly, horribly violent weather events as the entire climate changes, air and water currents need to find a path, everything has to stabilize which alone would take centuries if not tens of thousands of years but that is of course fiction even in your mind. Take a look at Earths history. Nothing happens that fast, except climate change, which is going to be 2-3 degrees of change over a hundred years. 

This actually raises a question: how long do you think terraforming will take? Will it happen in your life time in your daydreams? How realistic are your expectations?",,

**Devil's advocate from this point on**:

&gt; Sure, but just because something has always been done that way doesn't mean it's right.

True, but I think you missed my point. Your argument implies you're against all international agreements that are negotiated in secret (which is pretty much all of them).   Do you oppose the Iranian nuclear deal on the grounds that it was negotiated in secret? 

&gt; And in practice there will be no public vote, the negotiations will conclude and then the countries involved will ratify it, end of process.

That ratification you just alluded to **is** the public vote that you allege won't happen.  You just contradicted yourself inside the span of a single sentence.

&gt; At no point will be the people whos lives are impacted by this agreement ever be given any say in it.  

1. TPP has been in negotiation for 6 years, which means it actually was going on before the last election cycle.  So you've already had elections happen since TPP has been a thing.

2.  Politicians fear being voted out of office, so we still have leverage over whether they vote for it or not. Therefore if enough people voice their displeasure, you still effect an outcome on the passage of TPP. See SOPA for example.

3. It's a representative democracy (not a direct democracy), so we *already* had our say when we elected our current officials to Congress.  And since everyone knows that the person they're voting for deals with legislation like this, judging your candidate's position on trade deals should have been expected.


&gt; The corporations and politicians do not have our best interests in mind and we reject the entire premise of them dictating what happens in our countries to our lives.

1. Politicians aren't doing the actual negotiations. [USTR Negotiators are.](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Lead-Negotiators-2014.pdf)  Politicians merely approve or deny it when it comes up for a vote.

2. If you want to make the argument that politicians are too corrupt to be trusted to make **any** legitimate decisions, fine.  Just realize that the logical extension of this premise sacrifices any legitimacy you think the US government has to make law. For example somebody can use this to say “*The Iranian nuclear deal to avoid war with Iran is bad because politicians don't have our best interest in mind, so we should reject it*”.  Or how about this one:  “*We should reject any new EPA regulations to fight climate change because politicians don't have our best interest in mind*”.  Would you agree with that?  Because that's what you risk sacrificing with absolutist distrust of elected representatives.

- - -

Disclosure: 

* For the record, I don't really support TPP, nor do I oppose it. I believe in making evidence-based decisions, so I think it's best to wait for evidence rather than make arguments from ignorance or assumptions.  The lack of evidence-based policy making is already a big enough problem (like anti-vaccinators, GMOs, climate-change denial, etc).

* Regarding the corruption issue you brought up in the last bit, I agree we do have campaign finance issues that need reform.  I personally think it does compromise legitimacy, but not necessarily to the degree that it means the US can't enter international agreements.",,
1125,dftifv8,"Believe me, I am no 1%er.  I live comfortably through frugality.  I have no argument against the health care bill.  The solution the republicans came up with was garbage.  But ACA is garbage as well.  There is a better solution, and I'm interested in finding it.  Hillary was not.

How is the Trump presidency making America more vulnerable to terror attacks? Because last time I checked he is trying to get the refugees settled in Saudi Arabia.  Clinton wanted to bring many more of them here.  Have terror attacks gone up or down in countries that took in substantial numbers of refugees?

Those health care numbers are spurious.  A lot of the people getting insurance were people getting bumped to medicaid.  The number of practices that are even accepting medicaid is going down.  A lot of people are paying way more for their insurance and many have lost their insurance.  Trade tariffs make sense if you are in a trade deficit, which we are with multiple countries.  Protectionism as a rule is not ideal bit we have to do something and more tax money out of me is not happening.  The EPA is a ridiculous organization predicated on government overreach to solve a spurious problem.  I don't deny climate change bit I know that the 97% consensus is bullshit, NOAA is using altered scales and unverified data to predicate alarmist climate models that are consistently wrong.  And we are 20 trillion in debt.  I'm happy to admit the guy isn't perfect, but the sensationalist claims aren't helping.",,
1126,db8jizc,"Things like consuming less, recycling more, switching to renewable energy sources. Theres lots of little things individuals can do such as not eating as much red meat or walking/cycling occasionally rather than always using a car. You could even buy some solar panels for your house if you're so inclined! 

Whether you think that humans are the main cause of climate change or a minor one it's impossible to deny that we are playing a role in it. Either way, we have a responsibility to change our behaviour to stop what we cause. While it's unrealistic to get people to all go carbon neutral, we can all at least start by doing some small things. On a global scale with 7 billion people in the world, small things can make some major change. ",,

Is she accepting all seeds? Asking for a friend.

And frankly, as a young person in America, you should be afraid of the 300 judges from the federalist society.  They will not rule on your behalf on student loan issues.

The world is on board global warming is real and man made, its fringe to be antiscience in the rest of the world unlike on united states.

Just posting the qualifier of that headline. The article of course doesn't bring it up, but we will almost certainly not continue current levels of fossil fuel use all the way up through 2100. Absolutely no one within the energy industry predicts that. 

EDIT: Even a blog dedicated to information about the environment and climate change says we need to take a deep breath after reading that article: https://earther.gizmodo.com/four-things-that-could-kill-us-before-the-cloud-apocaly-1832899684",,

But all science disagreements aside. Even if your perspective on outcomes is accurate, I think the problem lies in the politicisation of the issue, which in tern causes the polerization as seen in your chicken Little analogy. The left has an incentive to make the case for climate change as strong as they possibly can, even to the point of being dishonest, because they are the party that supports action against climate change. Therefore the right has an incentive to do the opposite, to take away as much steam as possible from the left. 

It's sort of like how politicised the gun control debate is. Every time there's a shooting the left has an incentive to make as big a deal out of it as possible in order to play on the emotions of people who might otherwise vote right.

It would be a shame if we end up with a boring race this year. But on the other hand I don't think that this should be a criteria by which we evaluate/rate Zandvoort. It's an amazing and unique track with a great history as you pointed out. The changes that were made look very promising and the history of the track also has been respected rather well in my opinion. If we indeed will end up with a boring race, then I think it really ought to be in the best interest of the sport to have a honest discussion about the cars and regulations, rather than declaring the track itself to be ""unfit"" for F1 cars. While it may be true that Zandvoort isn't a great fit for modern F1 cars, I feel like it's one of the tracks that should be a great fit for F1 as a sport and the sport overall should relish going to tracks the likes of Zandvoort (another one that would be great to have on the calendar again is Kyalami, it's a shame we don't have a race on every continent at the moment).

Let's change the cars to have a wider range of tracks that they can race on. If that means slower lap times, so be it. If we are chasing fast lap times above all else, we might as well bring back TC and ABS, go back to lighter cars (be it by changing the engine regulations, allowing more engines per season or other changes), open up the regulation to more active aero, etc. There are plenty ways of making current F1 cars faster in terms of lap time. So any argument against changes that improve racing but result in slower lap times, lower cornering speed, etc. should include more than just appealing to the platitude that we cannot go back to slower cars. It's not as if indycar or other series are right up there with F1 in terms of lap times. There's plenty of room in between current F1 lap times and lap times in other series for future F1 cars. Higher cornering speeds and fast lap times aren't the ultimate measure of driver skill. 

The 2021 regulations in many ways are an attempt at fixing the cars, rather than pretending everything is fine with modern F1 cars and just going to a select few circuits that allow for overtaking. And I think that's a really positive sign that overall F1 seems to acknowledge the issues with the current cars. Whether the 2021 changes go far enough remains to be seen, but Zandvoort will be a track where we might be able to see how much of a difference the 2021 regulations will make once we get there in 2021.

The 2021 regulation change is mainly trying to address dirty air making it hard to follow and overtake. Which is one key aspect that needed to be addressed. However, they don't seem to address other problematic areas much. Such as for instance the weight of the cars. Admittedly, not an easy problem to fix if we are to keep the hybrid PUs, which we will seeing as how much money has been put into R&amp;D over the last few years and overall political climate within and outside of the sport.

1182,g992r4t,"&gt; I’m not quite sure how Jerry Brown caused water shortages.

I literally just told you. California had plans and money allotted to build levees and water reservoirs that would have supplied water up to 100 million people *even during* a drought. Droughts are a known quantity in this state, we didn't just discover them. Geological records shows this state is very drought prone going back thousands of years.

Jerry Brown literally ended the infrastructure projects that would ensure Californians had enough water. This isn't magic, this is basic construction and management. 

&gt; It’s been a problem well before he took office

I'm talking about 1975, his first term as governor. He came back and ran additional two terms recently. Which ironically his ""chickens came home to roost"". Yet he was not held accountable for it. Why? Because he deflected to climate change and idiots believed him. What other politicians fuck up on stuff like that and also are around to face the consequences of it? Yet he *still* was not held accountable for it. Democrats do not hold their politicians accountable for bad outcomes.

&gt;CA is less than 200 years old so not sure where you are getting the fire and drought data but that’s a big inference.

Geological data. We can look at grounds soil, water erosion, tree rings, etc to determine droughts and fires. This is basic science. If you're unfamiliar with this, think of ""carbon dating"", there are methods of determining what happened in the passed via different scientific methods. Ice Core samples, sediment, and so on.

&gt;Pat Brown did develop a huge water project but it didn’t deliver as much water as planned.

Pat Brown worked with Republicans on plans. As in ever expanding water infrastructure over a century. As in they literally had it figured out in the 50's and 60's how to support 100 million people in California given droughts. They setup funding and yearly projects to increase and expand water resources. Jerry Brown ended that in 1975. Guess what happens when you gut infrastructure and your population keeps growing?

&gt;I don’t think Reagan elected after him did anything. 

I think you are fundamentally failing to understand what ""plans"" are. It's a yearly budgetary item and approval process that allows levees and dams to be built. These were being worked on until Jerry Brown ended it. Then he sent the money else where. Reagan 100% followed this budget item, as it was agreed upon between Democrats and Republicans. It was a bipartisan initiative. 

Reagan served two terms and left office before Jerry Brown in 1975. After Jerry Brown no one attempted to reverse the cuts as it was a large amount of money being distributed else where. Politicians what immediately pay off to constituents, they rarely care about long term problems like this.

I will also note Jerry Brown failed to do any increases to water infrastracture. This is a problem with growing capacity as well as maintaining current facilities. Dams (like Oroville) are failing. Levees across central California were built in the 1930's and make New Orleans looked advanced and new. We have serious problems and Democrats are doing nothing to fix them. And when they fail (because they will) they will blame Climate Change.

&gt;I also believe climate change plays a role but I’m not sure if we’re talking Kobe or Kwame level lol or somewhere in the middle.

1196,cnh0kae,"Because that value doesn't tell us the whole story.

The amount of heat isn't nearly as important as the atmospheric makeup of the planet. If the atmosphere contained less greenhouse gasses, or contained something else that reflects more heat than ours does, then that extra heat would only serve to maintain an average temperature close to our own rather than heat things up. Our planet would be very cold if not for the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere, about 60 °F colder. 

Climate change is worrying because we are adding to the gasses keeping heat in longer at a rate faster than what would otherwise naturally occur, and therefore the planet's natural controls aren't keeping up. This leads to a slowly increasing temperature, because the greenhouse gasses retain the absorbed heat longer than it otherwise would have without them. This will continue until the global average reaches a new point of stability where the [energy budget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget) is once again balanced. It is able to reach a new balance because the energy gets radiated at a faster rate as temperature increases, as shown [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation#mediaviewer/File:Emissive_Power.png) 

Eventually, it would reach a point where the amount being radiated once again matches with the amount being absorbed/retained, and it will balance out. That's assuming we aren't still messing with it by adding more and more greenhouse gasses. Even if we stopped literally all greenhouse gas emissions, right now, we are going to still keep heating up for awhile. Of course, it will be some time before we curb our emissions, so the real question is whether or not we can stop our emissions enough to reach a balance that isn't too bad, and/or can be recovered from. This is why scientists are so insistent about it, because time *is* a factor, and the politicians/businesses getting in the way in the name of short term profit are only making things worse for *everyone* in the long run. 

There are other concerns too, about how heating up too much might cause pockets of CO2 frozen in ice or held in the oceans to be released, possibly leading to a runaway greenhouse effect that is out of our hands to control. That would probably be a mass extinction event, albeit a *very* slow one. The likelihood of that occuring though, is up in the air.",,

1201,eznciq1,"The issue of ""copying"" is certainly a barrier for many, however the biggest issue, with me as well as many others, is that we currently have only the beginnings of an understanding of how consciousness, memory, and mind actually operate, let alone how they generate personhood. Sometimes I wonder if the people who advocate for uploading and ""mind files"" are even human in the same way that I am? I've seen countless discussions about how creating a large base of personal factual information is a valid way to either reconstitute the person or to aid in doing so. How is this credible? For instance, there is a belief that a fact is equal to a memory. If write down or record my ""memories:"" of things and events they are *not* the same as my memory, or of my experience in recalling it.

Personal memories in humans do not exist in isolation and they are not experienced as such. I can make a ""mind file"" wherein I say that I like the smell of peonies, but when I recall that fact it is invariably accompanied by a vast reservoir of other memories and associations which are not present just as ""facts"", but which trigger an avalanche of other remembered things, some as sights, sounds, and whole narratives, as well as the attached emotional meaning. I may see my mother picking peonies our garden when I was 7 years old with the sun shining with my dog Tinkerbell cavorting nearby. Indeed, all my consciousness, as it interacts with my memories, is like this and if I were to continue down this path of thought and remembering, vast swaths, not of facts about my life, but of how I actually experienced it will emerge, all intricately connected and interacting. Indeed, my consciousness itself is emergent from the actions of myriads of ""sub-mind"" processes operating below the threshold of my perception

You can take all the facts about me you like, that I'm a man, that I learned how to ride a bicycle with training wheels and even which hand I masturbate with and all you will ever get as a result is mass of facts, which is about as much me as any photograph of me are. That this would even remotely constitute personhood, or that it could aid in restoring personhood, it is perceived as naive at best

This makes contemporary pronouncements that persons they can be operated on different substrate using different means and substituting scraps of information in the form of facts for the memories they are indicative of, seem hubristic, irresponsible and premature. People know how to hairdryers, yet I would be very doubtful about investing in a new company to make them. The point here is that people are quite rightly skeptical of new enterprises using proven technology to create proven products because they know, intuitively or otherwise, that there are huge unknows in any such undertaking that can’t be eliminated except by doing them -- which is a risky proposition.

People who assume mind uploading are in a far worse position, because unlike as is the case with hairdryers, it hasn't been done yet. Such advocates may well point to what they consider proofs of principle. That's like the difference between the publication of Tsiolkovsky’s rocket equation in 1910 and Tsiolkovsky trying to sell you a ticket to the moon! We made it to the moon 49 years later, but two generations have come and gone since then and we haven't been back. Why? Well, lots of reasons, most of them unforeseen and unforeseeable by Tsiolkovsky. The human space travel ""Singularity"" happened in the 1960s and yet, here we are.

Wise people, which is very often very different from smart people, understand this kind of thing. When I was a boy in the 1950s-60s, very smart people went around the country telling kids like me that the cost of electricity would the cost of metering it This would come about due to nuclear energy. In the mid-1980s, another very smart man, Eric Drexler, tried to sell me a similar line about nanotechnology. While I thought a lot of Drexler's technological insights, I thought his utopian ones were the same kind of foolish nonsense I had heard when I was 9 years old. If nuclear power got stalled because of its wicked and dangers downsides, well then, the dangers and downsides of nanotechnology make those associated with nuclear power seem like child's play by comparison. My own rule of thumb is that the power of any technology is *at least* inversely proportional to the amount of mayhem it can cause. Sometimes, we get a long breathing spell between actions and consequences, as has been the case with fossil fuels and climate change. But sooner or later the hazards must be confronted and dealt with.

Wise people understand this about uploading and cryonics. Aside from their speculative nature, these technologies are also extremely mischievous, and that is going to delay them or prevent them in ways we can only begin to imagine. Cryonics posits that if we have sufficiently conserved the structure that encodes the person, we *may* be able to recover that person. That requires a colossal leap of faith in and of itself and, overwhelmingly, most smart, wise or otherwise people do not find this reasonable. While I'm not and never have been an advocate of selling cryonics like hair dryers or toasters, and to as many people as buy these products, many others are. It should thus be obvious that they will get nowhere even faster than they already have by not only asking people to buy a ticket to the moon but to go by Transporter"" instead.

They talk about policy change. Let's get some examples then. What do they want changed? How is that going to impact on everyones lives? Are they willing to deal with the impacts? Are the majority of people willing to deal with the impacts?

1244,gkmypd1,"A lot going on in this post. The Paris Accord set emission guidelines for the world that if fully achieved may prevent about 0.2 degrees of warming. Proponents would argue it's a necessary step and worth the cost. Opponents would argue that the cost is disproportionate and excessive. I think strong arguments can be made for both points of view. My personal opinion is that it is more symbolic than practical as it is non-binding and ultimately does not make a significant impact on the future of climate.

On your first point I think you bring up some important points. Effective climate policy is going to require public buy in and legislation like the GND does not do the movement any favors, imho. You joke that it is about ""exterminating cows"" but a lot of people view it that way (silly, overly burdensome, too broad). We need policy proposals that make economic sense and are understandable before we can get public support. Policy proposal that call for the immediate (say, within a decade or two) elimination of natural gas/fracking which has driven the recent decrease in US emissions should be non-starters. Conversely, eliminating coal within the next decade might make sense if we can replace much of it with natural gas and renewables.

On your second point, this is more of an issue of the media/activists doing a poor job of reporting on science than an issue with the science. If your knowledge of climate change was what you saw in Al Gore's The Inconvenient Truth you may feel like someone is trying to pull the wool over your eyes given that there is still ice in the arctic and Manhattan isn't underwater. The thing is that ""documentary"" and many of these wild predictions are not well representing the underlying science. This also does no favor for the movement.

On your third point, I wouldn't really say living in a solar powered house for a week ""experiencing renewable energy"", per se. It did show you the problem of intermittency, no doubt. Anyone who is trying to sell the idea that we can power the world today with wind and solar is not providing you the full picture. This just isn't a thing yet but that isn't to say it won't be one day. 

It is very hard to have a conversation around climate change because it has become such a political topic. Discussing it in a productive way requires us to get over that but I can't say I am particularly hopeful of that happening anytime soon.",,
1245,fzvx02x,"&gt; The purpose is encouraging supporters of punitive measures to prevent carbon emissions to improve their messaging 

You might be in the wrong place, then, because I don't think ""punitive measures to prevent carbon emissions"" is something that anybody is proposing in this thread, or the underlying Court case. Emissions have to come down, and I believe I speak for a majority when I say I'm less worried about the burden of those emissions being allocated in a way to punish people than I am of people shirking their fair share by claiming they're being punished. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Leading by example is not an argument unless other countries will actually follow. 

That's not actually true. We can't control the US, Hungary, China, Brazil, or any of the other countries with autocratic, climate-change-denying leaders. We can control only our own national response. To forego doing what we, as a nation, are supposed to do, just because others won't or mightn't do what they're supposed to do, is not just irresponsible, it's bad policy. For example, we don't endorse protectionism just because other countries default on their trade obligations, and the Irish economy has reaped significant benefits from this policy. 

If the world ends because America and other such countries didn't do what they should have, then it will end no matter what we do; but if we reduce our emissions and do our part, at least we can say that we *did* do what we should have. We won't be consigned to lamenting how we let the worst of the world's leaders drag us down to our level; we will at least be able to point to how we were *different* from them, instead of leaving ourselves vulnerable to the nagging suspicion that deep down, we're no better than the idiots and autocrats.

1247,fz3vkjh,"1. Off the top of my head, I wonder if there's much difference between home heating/cooling vs that provided by employers. I've worked at some places that didn't provide adequate heating for employees, which was made even worse by huge rooms and high ceilings, so all employees had to wear winter clothes inside. Meanwhile at home, our place was so cozy and set up with a much more intelligent climate control design that we always felt very comfortable with fairly little energy use age. Cubic space of the work place vs number of employees would probably give you a better idea of how well a heating in particular would help. For cooling, some places only offer a fan, while others use actual air conditioning which tend to leak harmful gasses over time.

For (4.) Would be altered by what kind of food is prepared and how it's prepared. For example, I'd usually bring left overs from a home cooked meal for my work lunches, so for me, little if anything would change. If a company focuses on mostly providing plant-based foods there might be a significant decrease, but most places I've worked usually left us to our own devises, so my coworkers would usually bring their own food/leftovers, or drive to a nearby fast food place.

Then (5.) These sound like data you'd want to work out by area for sure since there's vastly different weather, electric grid compositions, and levels of access to eco-friendly transit depending on where people live. I think even the average distance people travel to work can vary drastically. Where I grew up in the UK most people could walk to work or grab a train, very few people I knew had cars and still don't, while people in the USA often tell me they drive 1-2 hours one way for work, which indicates a multitude of hurdles for them to fix (for which WFH could be a key element in tackling!).

Also, for the ""Number of people per household."" question, there's the additional issue of ""Would they turn off the temperature when going to work?"" Some people turn theirs down or off, but if the whole family is home and loses one person who goes to work at a place that is only warmed/cooled because people are expected at work there. 

I'm going to have to dig around and see what I can share on the topic. I read some really great stuff about bike to work programs a few years back, which I feel could contribute to the discussion, since biking reduces emissions and increases overall rider health.

When he finally did start talking about it a few years ago and everyone was singing his praises for doing so my main thought was, “You probably would have had a much bigger impact if you had done this *years* ago.”

The most proactive thing you can do is to extract yourself from the system, because it's a systemic problem. It's not easy to do entirely, but try to take small steps towards living less through the financial structures that are causing climate change. 


- Grow/cook/bake as much of your own food as you can, when you buy it buy organic and local.
- Buy as little as you can from major corporations
- Buy second hand as much as possible.  
- Barter where possible
- Avoid buying anything that comes in disposable packaging 
- Take public transport, walk or ride whenever possible, reconsider the need to fly or drive places.
- Try to stay out of debt
- Build your local community, make friends, share things locally, get involved in a local currency.


All of theses things have the benefit of making you more resilient in a crisis and weakening the system that is the problem. Climate Change is already happening and you're not dead yet. It will affect different places, in different ways and at a different times, even then not everyone will always be affected.

&gt; ""Wir drehen alle wichtigen Stellschrauben unverändert in die falsche Richtung"" - diese nüchterne Feststellung machte Gerhard Adrian, der Präsident des Weltverbandes für Meteorologie. Die Treibhausgas-Konzentration nähmen weiter zu, die Temperaturen stiegen weiter an. Und zwar in Deutschland stärker als im weltweiten Mittel. So der Befund des Wissenschaftlers. Zudem hätten Untersuchungen ergeben, **dass die Menge der Extremniederschläge, die zur Flutkatastrophe in Rheinland-Pfalz und Nordrhein-Westfalen geführt hat, ohne den Klimawandel mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit niedriger ausgefallen wäre**. Man wisse das alles, aber tue nicht genug, so Adrian.

&gt; Seit 1960 war jede Dekade wärmer als die vorherige: ""Wir verlassen den klimatischen Wohlfühlbereich"", meinte der Präsident des Club of Rome Deutschland, Mojib Latif. Wobei jedes Zehntel Grad weitere Erwärmung Extremwetterereignisse wahrscheinlicher mache. Flutkatastrophen, Waldbrände, Temperaturen von über 34 Grad nördlich des Polarkreises - man erlebe jetzt das Wetter, das die Klimaforschung vor Jahrzehnten vorausgesagt habe, sagte Wettermoderator Sven Plöger.

&gt; “**The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change**,” says WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas.

&gt; “**Economic losses are mounting** as exposure increases. But, behind the stark statistics, lies a message of hope. Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives,” according to Prof. Taalas.

&gt; [...]

&gt; “More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that **the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing** due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and **the growing intensity and frequency of weather events**.

&gt; Ohne eine geeignete Klimaschutzpolitik ist damit zu rechnen, dass es auch in Deutschland zu einer steigenden Anzahl und Intensität von extremen Wetterereignissen kommt. Dies wird in den kommenden Jahrzehnten zu erheblichen volkswirtschaftlichen Schäden in nahezu allen Sektoren führen. Laut Deutschem Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) werden die Land- und Forstwirtschaft besonders betroffen sein, wo es aufgrund von Trockenheit und Wassermangel zu Ernteausfällen in Höhe von insgesamt ca. drei Milliarden Euro bis 2050 kommen könnte. Durch Überflutungen und Hochwasser ist zusätzlich mit Immobilien- und Infrastrukturschäden von ca. zehn Milliarden Euro zu rechnen. Dazu kämen dann noch Kosten für die Anpassung an den Klimawandel (z.B. für eine Umstellung auf andere Anbaumethoden), deren Höhe für diesen Sektor auf etwa das doppelte der Klimaschäden geschätzt wird.

&gt;•Buy local produce - the petrol that's burned every year in international shipping is much worse than all of the cows farting.

I assume you mean international shipping of food, since you only mentioned produce. Could you link a source to that claim?


&gt;•Buy a solid used car and drive it for a decade at least. You can learn anything you want on YouTube including how to drive properly and not burn through your clutch every 60k miles. You can alsolearn about preventative maintenance that'llkeep your car running smoothly for easily 300k miles. It goes back to looking after your shit. You don't need a new car every 3 years.


Would also be interested in the numbers for this. Newer cars are generally more fuel efficient and better in terms of air pollution. Regarding climate change, I'm not sure if the advantages of having outdated models on the streets outweigh the disadvantages.

&gt;If everyone genuinely took the time to assess just how wasteful their lifestyles are, vegan or not, they'd soon see that targeting cows and chickens as some kind of diabolical environmental disaster is disingenuous.

For the record, I love your suggestions in terms of anti-consumerism and a more general environmentalism, but we're talking about climate change in particular here.

My goal is to change the narrative surrounding Climate Change from one of division to one of unity. From opposites ""factions"" yelling at eachother, lobbing insults from the fortress ramparts we have constructed on this topic - distractedly nitpicking minor details - and instead we can move towards unification by focusing the discussion on the things we can all agree on. 

To do this, we must listen to eachother. We must value eachother and our opinions. We must value and hold the standard of true and honest science. And mostly we must seek to find; and work towards, a common goal. We don't need to agree on the motivation why we choose to take action -  as long as we all agree on where that action takes us. We can all agree and unify behind the benefit of humans living sustainably on a fertile and healthy planet.

To get there, we must fight against the disconnection from nature which the past 200 years has created. We must re-integrate ourselves into nature, and work towards that on a daily basis. Because when ecosystems somewhere else are destroyed, we are complacent. But when the river that feeds the soils that feeds our children are damaged, we fight to the death.

Why is it that you see gaming sites as the home to this debate?  Isn't there, you know, an entire Internet where this debate is taking place?

What I'm not sure of is why you're so against curation involving some level of *conclusions*.  I know that global warming is real.  If I'm running a news site, why should I give airtime to someone who says it isn't?  Should I also give airtime to someone who says lizardmen are real?

I think this might be the fundamental point here.  Why is Kotaku supposed to be a home to debate?  What is going on here?  They've *never done that in the past*.

&gt;Was there more backlash against that article than that video of that black dude who found it offensive that they were generalizing?

No, but lots of people supported the ideas in that video.

&gt; I think they need to be more open on offering their platform to experts to discuss more in depth issues like that, rather than the current state where it's bloggers who're not really qualified to do it.

Experts like Anita Sarkeesian?

Does anyone have the credentials that Anita has, and a willingness to produce content for Kotaku?

&gt;Did they do it because they thought they were worthy or because they espouse a political viewpoint they agree with? 

I really want to get at this point:  This isn't a hard line.  Would they post someone they thought to be completely batshit?  Of course not.  We shouldn't expect them to.

They *ought* to curate.  You *oughtn't* expect Kotaku to sit back and go ""well some people say feminism is important and some people say it isn't"" if they are *really convinced* that it is important.  I do agree with you that they shouldn't promote extreme or fringe viewpoints, but that's not what is going on here.

Edit: Thanks for deleting the name-calling/abuse.

What I'm getting at is that only a few serious, large scale accidents have occurred - Chernobyl, Fukushima, Kyshtym, Windscale. Then you've got serious incidents like 3MI and Chalk River which could have killed people, but didn't. Overall, these kinds of incidents at nuclear power plants are very rare and most incidents occurred in the 50's, 60's and 70's when safety standards were lower and technology was less understood. Whereas modern safety protocols and newer reactors are much safer. With Fukushima in particular, the evacuation caused 1600 deaths compared to 0 from the accident itself. Albeit Fukushima did contaminate a large area.

When compared with the global effects of burning fossil fuels (ie: raising the global temperature, altering the climate, melting ice sheets, causing the mass extinction of animals and acidification of the Oceans), nuclear power is much more environmentally friendly.

One day, hopefully all of our power can be renewable and green. Until then, if we're going to take human-caused climate change seriously, nuclear needs to play a part.

1308,dhsqwal,"/u/blackjack_bot, deal me in

This is why #ImWithHer is so fundamental. America is facing the most dangerous, the most extreme, frankly too extreme to be taking seriously, threat that it ever has. Donald Trump is a fascist national-socialist theocrat with a racist, homophobic, transphobic, ect. ect. agenda that will hurt everyone who is not a straight white Christian male.

How extreme is the Donald Trump threat Consider the following

* Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns

* Donald Trump has bankrupted more companies than he has children

* Donald Trump's family original name is actually Drumpf

* His extremest agenda is so extreme it will take social issues back to 1650

What is the deal with his tax returns? It will allow us to see that Drumpf is actually not rich or wealthy at all, We would have indisputable evidence of his net worth and we will see that not only does he not pay taxes at all but he is also likely broke. How he runs his campaign, ect. is another indication. I interviewed the Field Director of Tax Law at H&amp;R Block about the matter. I asked him: ""Why doesn't Drumpf just release his tax returns once and for all?"" He responded: ""Simply, because he's to extreme to be taking seriously, and his tax returns would reveal that.""

Later, as we were driving on Interstate 405, with the wind cruising through our hair and tokking up to some dank weed, he explained further:

&gt;Drumpf's tax returns are the holy grail. I guarantee you, that it would prove that he is lying about everything: it will show us his net worth and it's likely near 0. He doesn't donate to charity and he doesn't pay taxes. I know this because I'm in the industry and I ""get it."" I can't go out and make this public but trust me it's true.

So why is Drumpf so untrustworthy? This is why #ImWithHer is so valuable, it provides answers. I asked about the ancestry, and the genealogy of Drumpf. What is the significance of it?

I went to the Head of Genealogy at USC to ask the question posed. Is Drumpf an indication of extremest attitudes? She replied, ""Absolutely.""

As we called for the elevator, she continued:

&gt;There's nothing wrong with the Drumpf name per se. But it's an indication of dishonesty. Trump supporters, you need to ask yourself: Why did he lie about this? What is he hiding? Perhaps he is a felon, a white collar criminal, or perhaps he is a peddafile. Why else would he be so dishonest? Hell, look at the tax return issues!

I brought her up to speed on the tax return issues after speaking with the Field Director at H&amp;R Block.

&gt;I knew it! This is why #ImWithHer is so important. We've gotten to the bottom of his tax returns, and we will keep uncovering issues and exposing Drumpf for the lying fraud he is. This is empowering. We are destroying the male intittlement behind his actions and we are, finally, for the first time, holding the top white, wealthy men accountable.

This ties in directly with the bankruptcies. Let's look at it logically

* Drumpf is a businessman

* Drumpf has dozens of bankruptcies on his record

* Drumpf has not repaid millions, if not billions, of dollars in loans as a result of the bankruptcies

Extreme much? Absolutely.

I wrote an essay in my Embodiments of Patriarchy class on this very subject.

&gt;It's not enough that Drumpf is an oppressive force, a testament to the white male patriarchy. He had to flaunt it with his bankruptcies. He stole money from working people and didn't return it. This is a femminnest issue because these actions affected women disproportionately.

And yes, I got an A for the paper. So where are we with this? We've exposed the damages of his bankruptcies, and his extremest attitudes.

His hatred of minorities, especially Mexicans and Blacks, as well as poor people, and frankly anyone who isn't a cis-white straight male is what makes him the most extreme. What could we expect from a Drumpf Precedency?

* Deportation of Mexicans

* Deportation and incarceration of Blacks

* Expansion of #BlueLivesMatter and Dissolution of #BlackLivesMatter

* Divisive attitudes

* Climate change that will affect the world

* A decrease in science and education

The last part is key.

Republicans absolutely hate Education. They know an educated people will never vote against there self interests. They know educated people ""get it"" and vote for candidates that offer them the most. This is why he would cut it.

Here's some more:

* More wealth division

* Tax breaks for the rich

* Tax increases for the poor

* Regressive taxes

* Private prisons

* Training camps and halocaust-style society

So where does this leave us?

You have to ask us: what kind of person would vote for Drumpf?

Here are some defining attributes:

* Don't care about black people

* Don't care about minorities

* Don't care he lied about Drumpf

* Don't care about climate change

* Don't care about gay and trans rights

* Don't care about bankruptcies

* Don't care about wealth division

* Don't want to redistribute wealth from the top to the bottom

* Votes against his own self interests.

I personally don't know anyone who matches that criteria but then again I don't know anyone voting for Drumpf. I asked the Southern Poverty Law Center's Voter Rights Division about these characteristics. I asked via email: ""Are these the characteristics of a Drumpf voter?"" They answered: ""Absolutely, yes.""

&gt;Drumpf is extreme. That's the bottom line. And the people that support him are fringe alt-right fanatics who are to extreme to be taking seriously. They want to take America back to 1650, to prevent equality, unless you are a white straight cis male, ect. ect.

So who votes for Drumpf?

&gt;Very few people actually. There's no way he could have won the election without some sort of fraud.

But isn't voter fraud a concern?

&gt;Yes, absolutely. Republicans are epic at voter fraud. when Drumpf won this is how we did it, so that

So how do we stop this?

&gt;The power is in the top 1% who need there wealth the least. This is why the power distribution and wealth distribution is such a problem. Do they need there money? Well, no, but that doesn't matter. They'll still steal money from the working poor who need it the most.

Such as?

&gt;Drumpf. Drumpf wouldn't pay his workers. He routinely stiffs people and fires them.

What can be done?

&gt;This is why #ImWithHer is such an important phenomena. Hillary Clinton is the only one that can solve the issue and that is why we need to support her.

The email continues:

If you

* Care about black people, minorities, and women

* Care about Drumpf lying

* Care about climate change

* Care about gay and trans rights

* Care about Drumpf and his bankruptcies

* Want a basic income

* Want wealth redistribution

* ect. ect. ect.

Then the only choice is to really join the #ImWithHer movement. Support a team that is looking out for the common good, for the 99% who neeed help from the Government the most, for the minorities and gay / trans people who need there defense the most, ect. ect.

In a couple of centuries we will have such a bad situation that only a small percentage of our population will survive while the rest of us will be wiped out. Unless we change things dramatically. Nature on this planet which has seen superdeserts when all the continents were one, then evolved massive amounts of humongous life - the long age of dinosaurs - when both plants and animals grew to enormous sizes. If nature could could go from a global superdesert to that, we are negligible.

In ther Sermons Vivec talks a lot about 'acting according to one's own nature', and he's a pretty hedonistic chap.

1321,d9xp5wd,"&gt; predictions of famine have turned out to be wrong, at least so far - in reality, technology and food production have been able to keep pace with population growth

Yes, but at what cost? As per my original contention, we're destroying our genetic heritage, losing species and ecosystems alarmingly. Humans may not go extinct but we can't technology our way out of losing and already having lost masses of species. Whether predictions of a dramatic contraction of the human population come to be or not doesn't really matter. Perhaps we'll manage to plateau the human population somehow, perhaps not. But what's for certain is we can't sustain population growth indefinitely. Even with all our wonderful technology there is no reason to expect or evidence to suggest that our competition for resources will pan out any differently to bacteria competing for nutrients on an agar plate, population wise. The planet is rapidly progressing towards a barren inhospitable place as we lose ecosystems and species. No doubt climate change is real and due to human activity but so what? The climate is relatively easy to mitigate with technology. As I said, some places will become less habitable or inhabitable, some will become more habitable. Climate per se is not the issue!

So to be clear, what I am saying is this. I care about the ""climate change"" or rather the planet from an ecological but NOT an anthropocentric perspective. The climate has changed due to human activity and will change again. Humans are a scourge, and at this point the fewer we make and the more we get rid of the better, especially those who have shown themselves to be unworthy, yes, in MY eyes. There is going to be intense competition for resources in the not too distant future exacerbated by climate change. People will be displaced, there will be wars, there will be slaughter.

My comment about the Middle East and _the whole of Africa_ was gratuitous and gratuitously controversial, sure. But you know what? If it comes down to superstitious, medieval, murderous islamists or me and mine in the technologically and socially advanced west, there is no competition. Ditto murderous, superstitious and ignorant hordes of Africans. If you look at the ""competition"" to date these people, largely through their own lack, have lost. This is the backlash against globalism. There will be competition and dire outcomes so why the fuck would I give these undeserving people a leg up at the expense of my people? Fuck that. The people in these backwards places need to come to terms with the consequences of their own behaviours, willful ignorance and geo-political realities and realise that if they populate to an extent greater than their technology, wealth and societies can support then they can't come crying to the west for haven and a ""new start"".

&gt;Because human suffering that results from ""conflict/war, famine, disease, pestilence"", etc. is a real tragedy, and you would probably appreciate this more acutely if you were experiencing it first-hand.

I've never heard Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro refer to themselves as a ""debator"". They both have much bigger things going on than debating people. 

&gt; rip these retards apart with ""facts and logic"". 

Yes, here it is. You're judging their intellect based off of a youtube video. Don't get mad at them because people take snippets from their channel and make titles like ""BEN SHARIO KILLS LIBERAL WITH HARD FACTS"" because it's clickbait, it's how youtube works in order for that person to get the most views. If you get tilted by a title of a video and the contents of that video, then I don't think the debating space is for you since a lot of different opinions are shared, you don't seem capable of handling differing opinions.

&gt;they gain a following that sucks their dick and believes every word that they say.

This isn't true. Some people agree with 70% of what Ben says and disagree with the other 30%, some may agree with 90% of what he says because that's their genuine belief system and they think and were brought up like Ben. I'd say there are some out there who do mindlessly follow certain people but the same goes for all E-Celebs and influencers, it's just how some people act. I have no doubt in mind there's someone you follow mindlessly and no matter how much they'd get beat in a debate you'd still take their side.

&gt;But when it comes time to actually debate things that matter like the economy, racial tension, global warming, and a number of other much more important topics they fall apart and start making up the most retarded arguments 

How exactly do they fall apart. In their defence they don't claim to know about 'Everything and Every problem ever created ever'. I have no doubt in mind Ben and others struggle to answer questions on certain topics because it's just not where the specialise. I didn't know because these people were public figures they had to know about everything. 

&gt;Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson have both publicly denounced their beliefs in climate change

Not true for Jordan Peterson as I watched his talk at Oxford Union. I can't speak for Ben as I don't know. Climate change is a tricky topic.

&gt; have made numerous racist and outrageous statements,

Jordan Peterson and Ben Shaprio aren't racist. Not from their numerous talks I've seen. From that statement alone I somewhat feel like I know where you stand politically and let's just say it's further left than a moderate leftist. 

&gt;and are in general kinda fucking stupid.

Just because someone has a different belief than you based on the facts they've gathered it doesn't make them stupid. I have no doubt in my mind they're smarter than you and I don't say that someone who's a fan of these people I say that as someone who sees an angry person who's just mad that people with different views have a following.",,
1325,f1p0zs9,"&gt;Capital is available if it the project economics work and the scale of the project is not ridiculous.

That's the scale of big infrastructure, if we just give up because private capital isn't interested we're going to dig a much bigger hole climate change wise and are very likely to not be able to get ourselves out.

&gt;We are consuming about as much energy as received to the Earth by the sun so renewables will simply never be enough unless you go to outer space.
&gt;The easy hydro/renewables sites are good start but that hasn’t -even scratched the surface and of replacing fossil fuel use.

You're going to have to pick a direction here. Either you're really worried about the task at hand being so large, thus we should start now no matter the preferences of private capital. Or you're not too worried and you'd rather wait for a technological fix to come around.

Ultimately I agree that wind/solar won't be enough, though it might be closer in Canada then most places thanks to our ridiculous hydro resources, that's part of why I support nuclear and am reasonably excited about the possibilities for the IMSR. This doesn't mean we shouldn't be building now though, every year those coal plants keep running adds a lot of CO2 and when the technological fix comes around we're not going to be able to implement it all in a year, there will likely be a fairly prolonged deployment.",,

1340,ijibh1y,"What I find interesting/horrifying is that inevitable turn towards fascism, and how rather than actually doing anything productive to address the situation, it’ll most likely accelerate it. We’re already staring down the barrel of it in America: when prices start rising even more they’ll turn to “strong men” characters who will tell them they’ll turn everything back to the way it was, and persecute the *real* villains, [insert group here]. The thing is that they won’t target the actual causes of the deficit, and since fascists usually have to bribe the fuck out of corporate interests they’ll most likely accelerate shortages due to ecological damage and climate change. Fascist regimes also rely on investing a ton of resources into control of their citizenry, which eats up more resources that could be used towards mitigating collapse, and it almost turns into a positive feedback loop of resource waste and oppression until it inevitably implodes.

But this isn’t just an American problem. I’ve been looking at the rise of Chinese imperialism, combined with India’s rise in authoritarianism, and Pakistan’s instability and it seems like a powder keg waiting to go off. India and China both get a lot of water from the Himalayas and the mountainous glaciers in that area (of which Pakistan is home to a lot of). But increasing temps and aridification are decreasing glacier melt yields, and both China and India are rapidly trying to industrialize to the West’s standard of living and need resources to do so but those traditional resources are running low. If China and India start fighting over the Himalayas, or India starts a war with Pakistan over their water rights, it could quickly escalate because all three are nuclear powers. Add into that Pakistan’s current economic problems and it isn’t looking great.

1389,h5bgcm7,"An alright movie. For once. Did the world really need it? Probably not. But it's also not a detriment.

Some of the characters seem a bit ""on the nose"", but nothing severe here either. I'm just happy they didn't go out on a tangent about how this threat was all man-made, because of our reckless consumerism and the alleged ensueing climate change.

Apart from that it was enjoyable, if maybe a bit long. The plot holes though (at least in my opinion) are glaring. As always, when time travel is involved, everything gets kinda muddy. So, the people of the future were overrun by aliens, but did find a way to create this sort of time travel thingy, which, for some reason, however, only works in set intervalls and exactly x years into the past? But once ""the group"" is in training, suddenly the next jump happens too soon?

They're also telling people, apparently, that they were chosen, because they didn't exist in the future, which is kinda brutal. While many of the past Earthlings, who had already died in the future, go to the future to die again. Basically, wouldn't all of this create several different time lines already? The future force already changed the past by travelling back and informing Earth of the danger. Their ridiculous ""goal"" is to send people from the past into the future to stop humanity's extinction, buuuut why do the people from the past care about this? It is not THEIR future. They now have the information about the threat and how to combat it. Sacrificing the current population for a future that is already totally fucked, no matter the outcome, shouldn't even occur to them. I guess, you could say that the future humans know so much about the threat that the past humans want to know as much as they can and help them develop this virus (if they even know about it until Chris Pratt gets sent forward), but if the future humans could come up with this, wouldn't the past humans also be capable of doing so? They could probably contain the threat or take the counter measures by force.

It's also a bit funny that the combined might of Earth's military failed to do what some bumbling idiots achieved. And why did the daughter specifically send for her father? He's the only one who can do this? Why? Bullshit, he's a liability, as we've seen. He would have died for nothing, jumping after his daughter to his certain doom. And by telling him all of what happened in the past, she basically changed his entire life as well and potentially prevented his death, creating a completely different time line again.  

Nobody of course saw the mass of creatures coming for them. And they seem kinda weak, but then unstoppable from scene to scene. Reuniting with his daughter back home was touching though, and well-acted.

Now that that's out of the way, they're somehow infiltrating Russian airspace, which is likely closely monitored, since the country has closed its borders, landing somewhere in the middle of nowhere, finding the alien location by accident, and deciding it would be best if they ALL take care of this themselves, instead of at least sending 2 guys back with all the information. They say they don't have time. Dude, you have almost 30 years! At least secure the evidence in case something goes wrong (which is very likely). So, of course the things wake up after the first ones die violently, because they failed to check out the entire ship and realize there's thousands of them down in the hold. And then they want to blow the ship up, but when did they plant the charges? And how many? Did they really get them all? Probably not. Maybe there's another ship. And they conclude all of this from ONE claw they've basically found decades later. It just seems ... very naive.

The movie's got a lot of stupid tropes. Comedic black guy, who can't shoot, but still somehow makes an impact. They ask a school boy (at least they set it up) about the volcanoes, instead of a renowned vulcanologist, they have several women, often at high ranks, who basically do nothing and are seemingly just there for the quota, another black guy who is angry at everything, and it's revealed it's because he has cancer. Tragic. And I'm not even really complaining, it's a sci-fi action flick. It deserves to have its stupid elements, but the whole time travel ""plot hole"" kinda annoyed me. A lot better than Army of the Dead. Doesn't really need a sequel though. Enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable. Though I imagine this is what an invasion of zergling-hydralisks would look like.

Why was gender dysphoria removed from the DSM-5? After reading about classification, It seems that if it is removed this makes it less likely for treatment to be covered from an insurance perspective. For example, Medical Cannabis is shown to alleviate PTSD symptoms and pain in areas, but as it is high schedule drug federally, it is not covered. If these treatments are shown to in cases improve wellbeing, wouldn't it be better to classify it as more definite. In todays climate, Mental health is being further destigmatized, but to remove the label of GD seems counter productive IMO.

Also, I feel that declassifying it does not serve this ""disorder"" justice. While objectively true it isn't a mental illness, its affect on a person's mental state is more than significant. I've met people who have GD, and to them their internal struggle with identity is in many cases debilitating to them mentally. To them it is just as much of a crisis as anything else.

You've still yet to establish why this is somehow different.

&gt; The weak point in normalizing per production is that it assumes that all production is necessary, which is not true.

That's an assertion, but it's not one that you can really support here. When people are free to produce as they see fit in a market environment, they don't just produce for nothing. Production is driven by consumer demand, and that isn't something you can unilaterally declare as unnecessary based on your preferences.

&gt;  As capitalism encourages unnecessary production for the sake of eternal growth while socialism does no

Bullshit. Enough with the ridiculous talking points that have no basis in reality. All economies must continuously grow, including socialist ones, because they have population growth.

&gt; So, to use your argument, two billion people producing 2x each is polluting more than same number of people producing x each.

This is not my argument. I'm talking about pollution in sum total. The planet does not care if a TOTAL amount of pollution of 2x is coming from 2 billion people or 4. The planet sees a worse impact from 2x amount of total pollution than it does from x amount of pollution, even if the x amount is produced by 300 million people instead.

&gt; Having a common sense argument is not my prerogative. I make a claim and I support it with something based on math or logic etc. Having no links to support is does not make it untrue. Moreover, links can be misleading as we saw. Youre welcome to discuss stuff the same way. If you will make me to see a logic fallacy in my claims by logic, I will not require links to be convinced. It is quite sad that you need directions on what to think and cant make up your own mind.

I've been giving logical statements all throughout, so this isn't true.

&gt; Huff post is indeed left leaning in story selection but NOT actually misleading in fact checking.

False. The reporting has numerous claims that are not supported by the facts. In fact your media bias website itself leans left. Might as well be referencing Snopes while you're at it.

&gt; To add another simple argument, which could be easily demonstrate the difference and to use much feared common logic, how would you compare Trumps vs Bernies environmental policies and how does this resonates with your argument? Do you think that Trump, being a clear representative if capitalism, is so worried about environment, he denied global warming until very recently, while Bernie (having lets say socialist inclination) is suggesting having a green new deal which is very focused on environment....?

The Green New Deal has been widely shown to be a disaster, even by metrics used by the IPCC report on climate change [which clearly showed that implementing such measures would make us worse off than waiting to deal with it later.](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/climate-change/using-ipcc-defeat-un-climate-agenda/)

(If that hadn't done it the baffling anti-mask bullshit would have done it.)  I feel like I'm decompressing from a cult.  And I'm not alone.  That gigantic win for Biden is proof.  Republicans with an ounce of fucking sense and whose families wouldn't literally murder them for it flipped parties.

So who's left by January 2021?  Lunatics.  Die-hards who would rather feed the constitution into a chipper shredder and support actual treason against the government than see the guy with the D next to his name win an election.  People with soft lives who have never suffered or struggled for anything, who are free to treat politics like a sports match.  Civil rights legislation passing or failing is, to them, just points on the board; nobody they know is actually going to get or lose any civil rights, so it's very distant.

Let me tell you about my grandfather.  He was a huge asshole and a staunch Republican his whole life.  He also fought in World War II, firing a cannon in Germany at the bloody end of the war.  He was at the Battle of the Bulge.  He would have fomented a *fucking riot* over Trump.  He would have never accepted such a man as president.  And I won't tell you his cure for sedition, but I'm sure you can guess.

What's left of the Republican party are spoiled losers who see themselves as my grandfather.  They have his asshole attitudes and his backward views and his early-20th-century rural American level of education, but they can't muster a scrap of his courage, fortitude or actual ideals.  They LARP around as cops or non-combat military guys and imagine themselves as heirs to the prestigious lineage of the heroes who saved the world.  (Keep in mind that for most of them their history education stops at high school, and American high school history's take on this is basically, ""All of Europe was fucked until Daddy America showed up and started handing out knuckle sandwiches until the bad people were dead and the world was saved!""  And for as much as I've praised my grandfather here, him and men like him did some serious damage to this country as well...)

The Republican worldview requires a *tremendous* amount of upkeep.  It takes time and energy and money to maintain.  For being the guys who gratuitously hate virtue signaling, they engage in it rapaciously.  You have to watch, listen to, read only pundits who frame arguments in a very specific way, and can conveniently exclude facts that contradict their point.  Fox News was always on.  My dad would take me to work construction with him and we'd listen to talk radio the whole time; he'd ask me questions about it and make sure I was engaged.  The youth pastors at my church (which we attended twice a week) were openly Republican and taught that it was God's party and all the good people are Republican.  I used to get Ann Coulter and Mark Steyn books for Christmas no matter what I asked for.  (As an aside, my first inkling that the whole thing is bullshit is when I tried out some Ann Coulter arguments on my high school classmates and some random highschooler fucking DESTROYED her arguments, and I had no answer because her books cover only cherry-picked counterarguments.)

And the handwaves.  My god.  How many rhetorical and mental techniques did I learn to brush away inconvenient voices without actually considering their arguments.  ""The source is biased!  Of course you think that way, academia is run by Marxists!  That person has stupid Tumblr hair!""  Eventually you get good enough at it that you can walk right by the truth slapping you square in the face and say, ""What an odd occurence.  Oh well, off to bust my ass as a dishwasher at a restaurant because if I work hard enough that will somehow make me a millionaire.  I'll invest or something; I mean I'm not doing it *now,* but later some day.  You can do anything if you put your mind to it!""

Difference I've definitely noticed after hanging out with more leftists (and something I would have vehemently denied as a Republican even though it's obviously true): Leftists gather facts and draw a conclusion from that data (although their personality biases how they interpret it.)  Rightists start with what they believe to be true and gather facts to support it.  Right-wing ideas have become so at odds with reality here that they're starting to require full-on conspiracy theories to justify, which they *have* to engage in because of the way their worldview works.  If you want to keep on believing that climate change doesn't real, you have to be ready to get on board the Jewish Space Laser train.  Now repeat with mass shootings being crisis actors, COVID being a ploy by Bill Gates and Big Mask...

So circling back to my original statement, this party has been shedding reasonable people for a long time.  There were absurd conspiracy theories swirling around the Clintons, and way worse ones around Obama as the mind virus grew.  Then it metastasized fully into QAnon, and we're reached the crossroads of destiny.  Either you can bail out of this flaming fucking car before it hits the bottom of the ravine, or you can gear up to be the party of anti-vaxxers and open white supremacists.  Everyone with a lick of sense has already bailed.  And those that are left are the kind of incompetent, terrifying, violent, drunken lunatics who are angry enough to try to destroy the government but lazy and stupid enough to film themselves doing it and then try to walk away like nothing happened.

And if they get away with it, that's it.  It's over.  We'll live in a country where bullets count for more than votes.  The military will run the joint briefly, then who knows?  Maybe we get our very own Napoleon.  Maybe we get a series of brutal dictators who keep looting the economy for decades and brutalizing anybody who's different.

1429,gk5o203,If anything it will look like us and we will resemble the shape form from now until forever as we no longer have survival of the fittest. We got to this point because of natural selection. Humans have lived through both hotter and much colder climates than today. My degree was environmental science and I've also studied archaeology &amp; geology along side my degree and work directly dealing with climate change as part of my job. It's not a scorched earth scenario we are heading into in the long term. It'll get hot first sure. But then we're more likely to end up in a snowball earth scenario ones the gulf stream breaks down.,,
1430,fo7q0nk,"I personally strongly believe runaway climate change is already underway. And even without human emissions the feedback loops already in play are heating the world up on their own. We are just adding fuel to the fire with our emissions.   


I think we are well beyond the point of being able to stop this ride now, we needed to act in the 1970s at the latest to prevent our doom. But instead we hit the accelerator.   


BOE will be soon, certainly in the next 2 to 5 years, each degree warmer we get will speed up the heating more. I think come 2050 we are going to be struggling with our environment, social unrest, food and water, and habitability.",,
1431,ewio9cn,"If you and a few million others changed your consumption habits, it would make a noticeable difference, especially if all of yous voted for better environmental policies and continued influencing others.

And a populace that is mostly veggie already by choice isn’t going to react as badly when the government imposes heavy meat taxes or whatever.

I agree that things don’t look great politically, and that the people actually in power don’t do even near enough. But what else are us common folks going to do? Give up, lie down and die? And the people in power are even less likely to do what’s needed if there’s no pressure from below.

1432,co0nes7,"Arctic melt is a big part of climate change and has major repercussions in Canada politically as well as environmentally. You probably don't have to go in to Arctic sovereignty and things like that (melt is weakening Canada's claim to the pole, Denmark and Russia are rattling their sabres a bit) but you can talk about shrinking Polar Bear territory. This threatens both their species livelihood and also there have been some incursions by hungry bears into northern communities.

Climate change is also changing fish population. The water is warming. They are changing their location and are dying off. This has huge repercussions for native populations and on people who make their living on fishing.

For Grade 10, that should be good.

But if I can make a suggestion--push the envelope a little. Make climate change a symptom of a bigger issue. It's a symptom of Canada's shift to an fossil fuel based economy, which has myriad other problems associated with it. Fracking, native territory rights, dirty water, the tar sands--it opens a whole kettle of fish.",,

2. Climate Change is 100% true, and by that i mean that a change is taking place that is agreed upon by everyone.

This change is related to man made influences. 

A shotty short explanation = Carbon monoxide ( CO) is a greenhouse gas, it is a component of the atmosphere and adding more ( from cars mainly) Carbon monoxide to the atmosphere raises temps on our planet.

Carbon monoxide makes up an extremely small % of the atmosphere and the atmosphere is in a balance or in science what they call static equilibrium. So artifically disturbing this balance creates warmer temps.

Humans appear to be adding so much carbon to the atmosphere that its disturbing this balance and causing a change....a climate change.",,

1446,cefsdg5,"&gt; It seems to me that to say that there is no truth or certainty is a claim to certainty.

100% correct.  I typed that at 6:30am...and reading it just now I realized that I didn't type what I was actually thinking.  That should have read, ""As far as human knowledge goes, there is no Truth or certainty.""  I was referring to the way I (and most skeptics) think about it so I can go about my day-to-day life.

&gt; Why wouldn't they use precise language, when everything else they do in their line of work is so precise?

Because the vast majority of the time when they say things like that, they're not ""in their line of work.""  They're interacting with non-scientists.  It's one of those difference between different colloquial uses of the word.  This is actually a very deep and timely issue.

When scientists write papers, articles, scholarly stuff, etc they are usually very precise.  They never say anything with 100% certainty (or at least almost never).  When they're talking to eachother, they probably use language like that but it doesn't matter because everybody knows what they mean.

The rub is when they're talking to non-scientists who don't approach the word from the midset of ""nothing is certain, everything is in degrees of likeliness.""  As far as your average everyday schmo is concerned, most things are black and white, not grey.  Something is either up or down.  Alive or dead.  Moving or still.  As you (hopefully) know however, none of those are actually binary like that.  All of them are on a spectrum.  So when a scientist talks to that schmo (either directly, or via an intermediary like a reporter or something), one of three things can happen...note that these are generally in order of experience:

1. The scientist isn't prepared for that difference in mindset and speaks colloquially like he/she would to other scientists.  They'll say something is certain, when that's not actually what they mean.  This used to happen a lot more that it does now, as everyone seems to be hyper-aware of the abusive power of mass media.

2. The scientist goes the opposite direction and assumes that everything they say will be taken literally, so they get super paranoid and qualify every little word they say.  This is what happened with the whole field of climatology.  About 20-25 years ago, unsuspecting climate scientists got ripped out of their quiet climate labs and thrown into the middle of one of the hottest and most divisive political issues in the past half century.  A few of them made mistake #1, and now the entire community is super gun-shy about saying anything definitive.  The problem with this is that when they say things like ""as far as we know"" and ""so far the evidence shows,""  that same average schmo takes that to mean that we're still not sure, that the ""jury is still out.""  That's all fine and good for discussion of nuanced issues that legitimately are still being worked out (like consciousness, intestinal bacteria, dark matter), but it's problematic with things like climate change, evolution, homeopathy, etc.  We are as sure as we could possibly be about those, but the ""qualifying language"" confuses the crap out of non-scientists, especially the ones on the opposite side of a political issue.

3. The scientist is aware of the differences between public and academic language, has practiced both, and knows which words to apply at what times to make sure that the appropriate message comes across.  This is obviously the ideal situation, but it's pretty rare.  Most scientists are too busy doing actual science to learn how to communicate to the public.  There are a few that have been outstanding (Neil Degrass Tyson, Bill Nye, Lawrence Krauss, Carl Sagan, Phil Plait, Steven Novella, etc).  People like that study and learn what non-scientists are going to think when they use different language.  They then spend a lot of time developing the skill of getting super-complex ideas across clearly and appropriately.  Actually, Dr Tyson has spend a lot of time trying to convince the rest of the scientific community that it's a skill they all should develop.
http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2011/03/01/neil-tysons-advice-to-young-science-communicators/#.UsXg0vRDsTw

All that said, ALL of them are aware of that all knowledge is subject to change if new evidence comes to light.  Push any scientist to get specific about it and they'll all say the same thing no matter what ""certainty"" you're talking about, ""As far as all the evidence shows, it's true.  We should teach kids it's true.  I believe it to be true.  Yes, it's true.  But if you show me reliable evidence to the contrary, I'll immediately change my mind and thank you for proving me wrong.""

1447,d1io5np,"The Airborne culture in Alaska is nowhere near what it is like at Bragg. Unless things have changed mightily in the past few years there. I don't know how many jumps you did at Bragg, but it seemed that everyone I was with in 4-25 was barely staying current on jump status. Like, there were numerous years that I did not hit double digits and I was actively trying to strap hang as much as I could to go to Jump Master school.

I honestly can't compare to other bases or the current command climate, but Fort Richardson (JBER) is an incredibly awesome post if you're willing to take advantage of it. If you like to hunt, fish, hike, or ski, you'd be hard pressed to find a better Army post. 4-25 is a young brigade, like barely a decade old, and was recently spared (temporarily) from being downsized as part of the cutbacks. Depending on your MOS and your attitudes regarding cold weather, I'd suggest giving JBER an honest look. Anchorage has all the amenities of any small/midsize city, with some of the best seafood you'll ever eat. At least in my 6 years there, it never really felt like ""Big Army"" was really aware of us, and those guys that came from units ""back at Bragg"" would come in all hard charging saying they were going to change things.

1450,f922guo,"Oh, an American doesn't like Thunberg because she's not charismatic enough, is that about right. Listen, I'm also an American, and I don't know if you've noticed, but *we don't talk about climate change here.* The world is literally being run by people like Clarkson. The three most powerful nations have figurehead leaders, all of whom are immature, irresponsible, egotistical, self-centered, soft-handed manchildren with fragile egos. Emperor Pooh, Putin the Queen of Drag, and the Orange Manbaby, are the official face of humanity, and in all likelihood, none of them are actually in charge or control of anything. They're all surrounded by sycophants just like them who are all ideal cult followers or would-be machiavelli's, and these incompetent clowns actually run things, they being the only people on Earth dumb enough to believe the idiots above them on the chain belong there.  


Our world is very literally being run by fully grown children, and meanwhile half of America doesn't even vote and 'doesn't care about politics' because they themselves refuse to grow up as well. The situation as it stands is fucking ridiculous to the point of being outright comical, especially seeing as we know that the worst case scenario would involve us all dying, and with that on the table *we don't even talk about it.*   


Thunberg does not have to be charismatic. She has a simple message that the world needed to hear. It was not intended to change any minds, it was a fair warning: ""You are all imbeciles. We all need to take responsibility for this and act right, and anyone who doesn't had better plan for retirement, because this dumb bullshit is officially over. We are legion.""  


It may be hard to believe, but assuming the worst doesn't come to pass, in the next two decades, give or take, sweeping change will come to the world as the post-net gens gently but firmly take the world out of the hands of the hopeless pre-net gens.

From an economic standpoint, it’s a little bit more affordable here than LA. Maybe 15-20% cheaper, which isn’t insignificant but you’re not going to be swimming in savings either. There’s also no state income tax so if you in a WFH profession, for example, that’s automatic raise. It’s still an expensive city but less so than LA. That said, despite doing well for ourselves here, we’ve recognized and decided that our dollars can carry us farther in other parts of the country that we’d like to consider for longer-term residency. Preferably somewhere with more sun.

The climate is drastically different than LA, night and day. The winters are rainy and dark, and it’s usually pitch black by 4pm starting in late October through mid/late February. How it impacts you though, I’ve found is entirely subjective and your experience will probably depend on how you approach it. Having spent 32 years in the SoCal sun, I think I’ve banked enough daylight that the last 3 years have not hit me very hard. That’s not to say I don’t get over the dark winters every year, but I don’t fall into a deep depression either. I try to appreciate the change of pace, shift activities to ones that are better suited for wet weather, and fly back to SoCal once or twice to get a break of sun. When summer gets here though, it’s absolutely perfect. Beautiful weather, some nights you don’t realize it’s already 10pm because there’s still a little sunlight out. This summer arrived late and, now that it’s here, has been particularly hot so far, though. In both wet and dry weather though, the nature is outstanding. If you love green, trees, forests, etc., you will be in heaven here. The PNW can be and is a breathtaking region of the US.

Homelessness, drug use, and transients are an issue, as some have pointed out. I live in Ballard and there are RVs and tents stationed up many of the main streets. They don’t usually get into the actual neighborhoods unless they’re passing through so it doesn’t generally interfere with my personal space. Based on my last visit home to the El Segundo/MDR/SM area in March, it’s not much different from what I saw in some of my old neighborhoods. My thoughts are if you grew up in LA and it didn’t get to you, you can probably weather that element here too.

The Seattle freeze can be a thing for you, but again, I’ve found your mileage will vary. It has not been the case for us. The neighborhood we moved into has lots of friendly people, and we became fast, close friends with several of them. I’ve found the city to be very accessible, even as a social introvert. There’s something for everyone. Culturally, it’s not as diverse as LA but it would be silly to expect it to be. Seattle’s metro population is about 4 million vs. LA’s 13 million, and well, California is California. Politically, the Seattle area is pretty liberal but gets red very quickly once you venture out of the city centers, if that matters to you. As some mentioned, you might get a raised eyebrow if you tell someone in Seattle that you’re from LA but you will get outright disgust in some of the mountain communities.

All in all, we’ve really enjoyed our time here and are grateful for it. We moved here for work and there are many worse places that we could have had to relocate to. If you can, I would recommend you spend a week or so here and pretend you’re a local. Live a couple of days like you might if you lived here versus being a tourist, and that might give you an idea if this could be for you.",,

In general, what I'm advocating over all areas of policy would likely see a freer market and less government involvement in the economy, but better environmental policy and a more proactive welfare state even with lower to net neutral levels of spending.

* I believe moon landing is real
* I do NOT believe ""Flat Earth""
* I do believe in climate change and that its man-made
* I believe the government was involved in, or at the very least, knew about ahead of time, and still DID intentionally let 9/11 happen in order to institute legislation like the PATRIOT Act and expand their power in the Middle East, particularly the opium (poppy) fields in Afghanistan, and the oil in Iraq
* I do believe that the Holocaust was absolutely real and 6 million people (actually more, when counting both Jewish people and non-Jews!) were murdered by the Nazis
* I do believe COVID is real, however I ALSO believe that the virus was deliberately engineered through ""gain-of-function"" research in China funded by Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and other elites and that it was either an accidental ""lab leak"" (which doesn't change let alone minimize or eliminate the evil, if the virus was indeed engineered in the lab) OR was even intentionally released, in order to create a global crisis that they could use to not only PROFIT MASSIVELY from (as they ALL have!) but also to justify taking the steps that erode every last vestige of people's freedom and human rights and bring about the ""Great Global Reset"" and ""4th Industrial Revolution"", basically a plutocratic surveillance state (like China's ""social credit"" system) -- in which, in the words of Klaus Schwab, ""you will own NOTHING and be happy""
* I do believe that the Democratic primary elections WERE rigged  against Bernie Sanders in 2016 and 2020 and that he was threatened into dropping out and endorsing Clinton and Biden, however, I don't necessarily believe that the general election was rigged, - by the same token, I don't dismiss the possibility outright, either.
* I do NOT believe in the existence of a ""Jewish conspiracy"" to take over the world -- but yet, I DO believe that there IS a conspiracy of the 1% elites (regardless of race, or religion) to take over the world, and everything that has happened &amp; been happening (the buying off of politicians, elite-friendly legislation like Citizens United, people like Bill Gates buying up MASSIVE amounts of farmland, as well as the billionaires buying luxury underground bunkers and survival estates in places like New Zealand) DOES bear that out
* I do believe in vaccine injury (note my screen name -- I've been left on permanently disability by so-called ""safe vaccines"" and every additional vaccine I got from birth to age 30 \[when I finally ""connected the dots"", wised up and stopped getting them\] further deteriorated my health/caused more and more medical issues) and so I believe that vaccines should be a private &amp; personal choice that each person is free to make based on their own health history and co-existing issues, genetic vulnerabilities &amp; family history and risk level, and that vaccines should never be mandatory. I also do believe that vaccines are one of the tools that the elites are already or will be using in the future for control.
* I believe fluoride is a toxin and should not be used
* I don't necessarily believe in chemtrails, however I cannot say definitively either way as have not really looked much into it, since I am more interested in vaccine injury issues especially as that involves me directly
* I don't believe Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. I think he was silenced to keep him from revealing incriminating information about his ties to the Clintons, to Trump and to numerous other highly powerful &amp; influential public figures
* I don't believe Pizzagate is real
* I don't believe that there's a bunch of ""lizard people"" running around disguised as world leaders
* I don't believe that Sandy Hook or any of the other mass shootings were faked or that the victims were ""crisis actors""
* I do not believe the official narrative of the JFK assassination. I think Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy for JFK's murder, the same way that James Earl Ray was proven in court to be a patsy for MLK Jr.'s murder. I think that JFK's assassination was orchestrated by George HW Bush and people in the CIA and elsewhere (the banking world, the growing Military Industrial Complex, etc.) because JFK was planning to repeal the Federal Reserve Act, and use ""greenback"" currency (instead of the debt-based, PRIVATE Federal Reserve bank's currency) as well massively downsize the CIA and elements in these agencies did not want that, So JFK was assassinated and the power/influence of both the CIA and the Fed has massively ballooned even more since then.

* I don't necessarily believe in God but like the previous two points I don't dismiss the possibility outright, either
* I am a secular humanist anti-theist who wavers between agnosticism and atheism, but thinks organized religions are a man-made scourge on society that only creates senseless conflict, war, and separations/divisions, and all of the money, time, energy &amp; resources that are wasted on religion, could be put to so much better use eradicating poverty, cleaning up the environment, saving wildlife and other needy animals (stray cats &amp; dogs, etc.) and otherwise improving the world.

1480,ihzbqmr,"&gt; Look around the US right now. We're dealing with Christofascists.

What you said about the MAGA crowd is true, and I'm not denying it. But, that's a recent problem and the older form of Christianity has a different problem. Even more, even it's not that universal. A [poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2020/03/12/white-evangelicals-see-trump-as-fighting-for-their-beliefs-though-many-have-mixed-feelings-about-his-personal-conduct/) done by the Pew Research shows that although, admittedly a minority, 37% says that Trump is not that morally upstanding, and 18% says that Trump does not fight what they're believing in.

For some stances like plandemic conspiracy and global warming denialism, this can be explained better from their political affiliation. For the plandemic conspiracy, this can be shown by a [poll](https://www.statnews.com/2022/01/07/covid19-vaccines-evangelicals-hesitancy/) by the Stat News. They reported that Black Evangelical church are less hesitant towards vaccine than the White Evangelical church. And Black Evangelical church is more likely to be Democrat than a White Evangelical. Similarly, another [poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2015/10/22/religion-and-views-on-climate-and-energy-issues/) by the Pew Research shows that White Evangelical is more likely than Black Evangelical to deny climate change. I think for abortion stance it's probably similar as [Black Evangelical also leans more into Pro-Choice stance](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/historically-black-protestant/views-about-abortion/). But for the last one, I admit I lack better evidence.

Also, you're lumping Christianity = Trump-extremist. Sure, there is such tendency, but again, not universal, and the correlation is better assigned to the political alignment, anyway.

&gt;Yeah, but only one of them worships a God of War who resorted to genocide and slavery at the drop of a hat. Non-Abrahamic versions of Christianity rejected the God of War; Abrahamic Christianity embraced him.

You realize that that God of War is supposed to the same God as the Judaism God, right? By the same logic, the Jews are a violent people. (No, I don't think Jews are violent. I'm just using a proof of contradiction)

Also, put Muslims, Norse paganism, Hindu, etc in the same picture. Worshipping a war god or having a war oriented religion is to be expected in a religion originated from a war-torn nation.

Then, didn't I say that what's matter is how their cult view their own God. Not what the other cult says. You can't apply the doctrine of Christianity to judge what a LaVeyan Satanist pray to. Satan in that religion symbolized noncomformity and rebellion against the dominant system, not a god that allows them to do many vices. 

&gt;They are. Have you ever discussed the war crimes in the Tanakh with them? I have. Numerous times. They fully support and defend them.

In practice, they won't do so brazenly, especially in place where I lived, Indonesia. They might justify them by ""a change of law from the Old Testament to the New Testament"" or ""Because God allowed them to do that, the extremist does not have God's permission"", or ""Because the people there was evil"". Which is an inconsistent belief, I know that very much, but shows more about the flexibility of the religion.

&gt;Look over the history of Christianity. Does it look like the religion of a God of War or a God of Love?

I know the history of crusade and religious persecution. You don't need to teach me about me. And I'm not claiming that Christian God is a God of Love either. I just claim that the Christian values depends on the social mores of the members at the time. The church that served Black people obviously did not appeal to White Supremacy, because that would be counterproductive to the existence of the Black Church. Also, historically, Catholicism did actions that is over the place with respect of the antisemiticism. On the one hand, they believed in Jewish deicide, something that modern Catholicism retract, and there is also persecution in some areas where Jews are forced to convert or suffer from death penalty. On the other hand, Catholicism often made an action protecting Jews like how Pope Callixtus II issued Sicut Judaeis, which forbade forced Jew conversion on pain of excommunication. On the flip side, other popes like Pope Paul IV oppressed the Jews.",,

Uh... Did you look it up yourself? or did you read some other person's opinion on it that aligned with your political leaning? I'm reading it now, and by reading it now, I mean I'm reading all the supports it says to endorse/commit to, including the 

Charlevoix Commitment On Equality And Economic Growth;

Charlevoix Commitment On Innovative Financing For Development;

Charlevoix Common Vision For The Future Of Artificial Intelligence;

Charlevoix Declaration On Quality Education For Girls, Adolescent Girls And Women In Developing Countries;

Charlevoix Commitment To End Sexual And Gender-Based Violence, Abuse And Harassment In Digital Contexts;

Charlevoix Commitment On Defending Democracy From Foreign Threats;

Charlevoix Blueprint For Healthy Oceans, Seas And Resilient Coastal Communities;

Charlevoix Blueprint For Healthy Oceans, Seas And Resilient Coastal Communities; and the 
Gender Equality Advisory Council. 

It also mentions a commitment to replenishing the Global Fund by 2019 (a the cost which could range from $13 billion to $97billion over the 3 year 2016-2019 period).

Now, either this is toothless and meaningless in which case Trump not signing is meaningless, or if it would have been meaningful/it's meaningful that he didn't sign it, then presumably that would mean, not only signing, but following through on the zillions of commitments I'm reading now. There are TONS of initiatives in there. [You can read all the documents here](https://g7.gc.ca/en/official-documents/). There are plenty of politically charged affirmations and initiatives that nobody who represents the nation should commit to on behalf of all their voters just for a ""toothless and meaningless"" agreement that would nonetheless get his signature of affirmation, Especially when the argument on the right is that just because someone might personally feel they themselves would do or say or affirm something, that it's not the role of government to take these actions on behalf of everyone. I mean, ""Support removing gender biases in the development of digital platforms and connected technologies from design to end-use.""? What if the tables were turned and it said something like ""Support educating single and/or impoverished mothers about the sanctity of the unborn child and the financial assistance available to them for choosing to not kill their babies"".

People can't have it both ways. Either this was meaningless in which case who cares if he signed it; or it is meaningful and all the programs listed inside should be given organizational and financial commitment. 

Under the Charlevoix Blueprint for Healthy Oceans, Seas and Resilient Coastal Communities, Annex: G7 Ocean Plastics Charter includes a lot of program and initiative oriented assertions; Which, interestingly, there's a footnote in this document that reads ""The United States strongly supports healthy oceans, seas and resilient coastal communities. The United States has announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and **reserves on the climate related language in the Blueprint**."" Hinting at the whole issue in the first place. There are sections of the document that would include assertions and consequent actions that have far reaching implications for people whether they voted for the person signing this or not, on industry, policy, etc. People elect an executive in the american system to execute the laws and programs that are enacted by congress. There's nowhere in the constitution that says the president can then go off and start agreeing to broad ranging commitments (again, is it meaningful or not?) that people didn't vote for?

Section 5 Coastal and shoreline action, subsection b. Accelerating implementation of the 2015 G7 Leaders’ Action Plan to Combat Marine Litter through the Regional Seas Programs, initiatives led by RFMOs, where appropriate, and targeted investments for clean-up activities that prove to be environmentally sound in global hotspots and priority areas, in particular on Abandoned, Lost or Otherwise Discarded Fishing Gears (ALDFG) and wastes generated and collected by fishery activities. What does that even mean in terms of action and $? Now I have to read the 2015 G7 Leaders' Action Plan to Combat Marine Litter! *pulls it up* Surprise, far more initiatives. These aren't free. 

Subsection from that under ""Responsible investment and sustainable agriculture"", ""We commit to promoting best practices for adaptation to climate change and take note of new initiatives, e.g. the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture."" What's that? They appear to be a UN think tank on best practices like the passage implies, however, looking through the briefs they've published, among classic hits like ""Manure helps feed the world"" and ""Solar-Powered Irrigation Systems"" is ""A Gender-responsive
Approach to Climate-Smart
Agriculture"". 

Now what is contained in this document? The following statement: ""(Gender equality) **implies equal
participation of women and men in decisionmaking**,
equal ability to exercise their
human rights, **equal** access to and **control
over resources**""... now on the surface this seems like a noble statement and our conception of equal opportunity. The problem is that these types of sentiments have been twisted into ""if it's not 50/50, it's the sexist patriarchy at work"", and this is just one of a seemingly infinite set of branching implications. Because if the president signed this document, he is saying that he affirms he will promote that gender equality is equal participation in decision-making and control over resources. Think about the category of that statement politically and whether people would be so keen for him to make that commitment if the statement was one they disagreed with the twists of. 

I know it seems like a complicated argument when I start running through the details, but it's not a simple document. And the essential argument is simple; either this is a meaningless document in which why sign it, and why does it matter that he didn't sign it, or the meaningfullness doesn't come from how toothy it is, but that if he did sign it, he'd implement it right? Well the document isn't as simple as the first read; it includes extensions of affirmations and commitments to a chain of documents, some of which Obama signed that he may be opposed to or campaigned against, and that plenty of people fundamentally don't agree with the construction of. That makes these types of commissions and policy actions undemocratic and unwise.",,

My father is a buttigeg supporter and the way he puts it it’s very understandable.
He’s socially liberally. (Pro minority rights, pro planned parenthood, pro common sense gun control.) But fiscally he leans conservative.  He’s a 57 year old man who works a blue collar job and he’s and wants to retire as soon as he can. He’s not for a drastic change In our tax policy. It’s safe to say a large majority of Bernie supporters are either millennials or gen zers. Who know that even if their taxes go up. They can take it because in the long run it will improve their chances of getting into the middle or upper middle class. Boomers and gen xers like my father don’t want a revolution. Not this late in their lives. If you’re over the age of 45, been working at your job long enough to where you have full time and benefits and some how you’ve made into the middle class. Bernie’s revolution seems to you like it may hinder your progress rather than help. My dad’s not an idiot he knows climate change is real. He knows billionaires are taking advantage of both the working and shrinking middle class. But for those who have retirement in their next major goal in life. Well they feel more attracted to a moderate who will fight for social issues make our economy more green, and doesn’t plan on more taxes.

These people aren’t like hey “let’s pick gay Obama this time” they simply aren’t interested in a total uproot in the system this late in their lives.

1507,emqz8cq,"I’m not a conservative, so I’m going to eschew all the reasons that I don’t like Trump that are based on policy——I think a lot of conservative policy is wrong and almost ALL of the GOP policy is wrong. 


But Trump is different. Here’s why:


-He’s wildly dishonest: he lies about small things and big things. His entire administration is built on lies, explaining his lies, justifying his lies. Many think it’s some grand strategy to distract, ‘The Russian Firehouse’ tactic, some 1984 doublespeak he’s perfected, but I don’t think so. I think it’s compulsive and gotten worse/less slick as he ages and loses faculties, and it FUNCTIONS as 1984 doublespeak/Russian Firehose tactic.


-He is apparently entirely without morals or decency: this goes way back—-his response to 9/11 was to say that his building was now the tallest. He also lied and said that he was down there clearing rubble (he did not do that) and later applied and got small biz fund relief. He started that fraud university to bilk desperate people out of their money, which is truly ugly because those folks were trying to better themselves. When Puerto Rico (whom he is president of) is hit with a disaster, he shits on them about money. His charities are fake, often not giving way any of his money or any money at all. He promises to make donations and then doesn’t. There are countless stories of him behaving cruelly or inappropriately as a human, in terms of caring or empathizing. Let me be clear, I’m not saying he’s necessarily a sadist who likes the pain of others, but he is very clearly someone who does not empathize with other human beings in even a minimally human way. 


-He is anti-intellectual/incurious: Dumb is not the right word. I doubt he’s below average intelligence. But he really is someone who took being tall and born rich, and built an entire life on the premise that image is everything. He’s uninformed about a lot, he thinks being informed is a waste of time, and it shows. For example, Many in the GOP deny climate change and I think that’s dumb. But Trump doesn’t even understand it. He can’t steelman SHIT. He distorts and lies about his opposition’s positions, which I hate in a redditor. In a president? Jesus.....


-He’s unpatriotic: Liberals aren’t known as flag-wavers. I sure ain’t. I’m revolted by the idea of reflexive “America is the best!” Chanting. But we are supposed to be a team aren’t we? The fact is, Trump and his team are proven to have had 100 contacts with the Russians (PROVEN), were offered help in the election (PROVEN), and said they would like help (PROVEN). A dozen of our intelligence agencies said that Russia attacked our elections and interfered, but Trump stands next to Putin and says he believes Putin. Our intel says that they’re going to interfere again. Trump and Putin get on the phone and talk for 60-90 minutes, but no mention of Putin’s ONGOING ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY?! Why? Because Trump knows that Putin is cheating for him. And since he’s dishonest, without morals, and doesn’t care about democracy, he’s happy about it. Repugnant. 


The things listed, among others but outside of how I feel about supply side economics and abortion, are why Donald Trump is an awful human being. If you say “well I like the policies and/or owning the libs so I don’t care” then I think you’re like a sizeable amount of the GOP, and I think that’s awful but you aren’t alone.

1509,e39cqdw,"I'm sure my comment will get buried, but…

Climate change will disproportionately impact the higher latitudes (poles/melting ice caps changing currents) and the tropic zones (direct exposure to sunlight coupled with deforestation is causing rapid desertification). Polar region warming is causing animals and insects to either die out or move south in search of food. The tropical latitudes are quickly becoming uninhabitable as locals lose the ability to farm, hunt, and fish.

BOTH human and non-human life are beginning to migrate to lands that can still support life. The environmental impacts of this kind of migration could be absolutely devastating as it threatens to overload ecosystems which already struggle due to current usage and pollution. While something like a wall might be able to keep humans out, it certainly won't stop birds, fish, and insects, for example, which have the potential to destroy an ecosystem that isn't equipped for this kind of migration. 

Switching to a plant based diet is the first thing we all need to do RIGHT NOW. [The commercialized meat, dairy, and egg industry is responsible for about 20% of greenhouse gas emissions world wide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aWr-EDfB4HT5qcpC8t1bSpLEpKxHGbNW8qyc3zUuHpU/edit?usp=sharing). These emissions are not just methane from the livestock, they come from deforestation, land conversion/loss of natural carbon sinks, livestock feed production (growing, shipping, ect.), meat packaging, freezing, shipping, and so on. 

Another point I'd like to make is that we need to start pushing for meat alternatives, such as [lab grown meat](https://redd.it/737klj), and [meat substitutes that taste exactly like meat](https://impossiblefoods.com/food/), as it has the potential to be eco-friendly when executed correctly. Meat eating (and food in general) is a huge part of many cultures around the world, and I don't think it would be fair to deprive people of this.

I know a lot of people don't like the idea of abstaining from consuming animals and animal products, but it's something we must do right now (only until we develop an alternative) if we want to mitigate climate change.

Here is a link to [a google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WOD1eZAJzgFILsUSIaw6tTLf2exP-1QmnViFpwOHpaw/edit?usp=sharing) containing the information below along with a comprehensive list of subreddits you can join to get more info about sustainable and environmentally friendly living.

No rain drop thinks it's responsible for the flood

FOOD:

* eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment. So adopt don’t shop to discourage their production, and try to choose pets that are herbivores
* avoid palm oil (aside from food it is also a common ingredient in other products, for example soaps and washing powders)


ENERGY:

* drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying
* use efficient light bulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary, adjust your clothes first
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* Use solar every where you can (solar lights are relatively inexpensive and work great!)
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants


WASTE: 

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while * buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging
* Do not buy glitter, or anything that contains glitter (clothing, make up, junk that you hang on a christmas tree)


WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering

REPRODUCTION:

* Use birth control, and encourage others to use it
* Limit your family size to no more than two children (none is best)
* Please consider adoption before having your own children

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Support carbon sequestration technology

Edit: fixed a sentence

Edit2: This got more attention than I thought! I can’t answer each reply, so I'll update this:

I see a lot of people have some anxiety about “lifestyle changes”, and the idea that generations today are essentially stuck cleaning up after previous generations. See my response to this [here](https://redd.it/92uxy5).


Many of you have brought up systemic issues which prevent the lifestyle changes mentioned in the list above. I agree; our current economic and government systems do not work when we consider the environment. It should go without saying that these systems will also need to start changing if we are to address climate problems. I’m not a political scientist or an economist, so I have no idea what that might look like, but I do understand that this won’t just happen because we bitch about it on reddit. We need to make sure our leaders hear these concerns, which is why I emphasize voting and contacting policy makers. 

Some ecologists and climate scientists have proposed that the problem of climate change is not necessarily our lifestyles, but the fact that so many people are living the way we do. Decreasing the population would also decrease emissions, garbage, and land use. On the other hand, other scientists believe we can continue to populate exponentially as long as we reduce pollution and use advances in tech and science to mitigate climate change while maintaining our lifestyles. I happen to be a pluralist when it comes to this issue. 

Right now, humanity avoids addressing climate change because we’re afraid of the lifestyle changes. Personally, I don’t believe we have to change very much. [We can still eat meat](https://redd.it/737klj), and we can still live comfortable lives. We do need to find [an alternative for plastics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) as this is [destroying ecosystems around the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWgfOND2y68&amp;feature=youtu.be). I also think we need to seriously start pressuring entities that own large buildings in metro areas to upgrade things like insulation and install automatic light sensors. [The business sector uses a lot of energy on heating and cooling](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf) (PDF WARNING), but this can easily be curbed when older buildings are updated. [The Empire State Building in NYC was recently renovated and upgraded to be energy efficient and the building now uses 40% less energy](http://www.esbnyc.com/esb-sustainability/project). Changes like this would reduce [the amount of energy we use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) and we’d be giving up nothing. We can also do this in our homes, which will lower utility bills. 

Someone mentioned [albedo](https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/education/pbs_modules/lesson2Engage/) and positive/negative feedback -- yes, these are huge problems (albedo is one issue that I am particularly interested in researching). Just because we don’t have a solution this very second doesn’t mean we won’t in a year, or 5 years, or 10 years perhaps. Tackling climate change isn’t going to be easy, and it’s not going to happen overnight, but with each step humanity takes, we give ourselves more time on the back end. If we start with conservation (such as the building renovations mentioned above) and cutting down on plastic waste, we will slow the overall warming, giving us additional time to address the more challenging issues such as feedback systems. 

There are still a lot of questions that need to be answered, but I love the discussion y’all have sparked here. Over the last few years, we’ve gone from “climate change isn’t real” to “how do we solve the problems that are created when we address climate change?”. I think this is great! I implore anyone reading this to keep discussing these problems with family, friends, online, with your employer, and with local and national leaders. Discussion is how we find solutions.

1525,d0m41bz,"Climate change is occurring for a reason. It is occurring because the owners of fossil fuel industries care more about maximizing profit than they do about long-term sustainability. In all industries, profit comes first and sustainability comes second, whether it's with planned obsolescence in tech companies like Apple or with the fossil fuel industry. And because profit comes before sustainability, climate change and its related deaths, destruction and chaos are endemic to the capitalist system. 

It's becoming increasingly apparent that our planet is at a crisis point. In the next century, climate change has the potential to destroy our civilization. And since climate change is endemic to capitalism, the only way to ensure the long-term survival of our species is to build a system where production is owned and democratically controlled by the people, where human needs and sustainability are recognized and viewed with the utmost importance, and where the profit motive is abolished.

A liberal, capitalist approach to climate change will get us nowhere. Attempts have been made to lessen the impact of climate change before, like the Kyoto protocol. But these measures don't go nearly far enough, because going ""too far"" would be detrimental to the profits of the businessmen who control the politicians that make these decisions. 

If capitalism persists for more than a few decades longer, there is a very real possibility that human civilization and society will collapse, that hundreds of thousands of plant and animal species could go extinct, and that billions of lives will be lost.

First of all, I am biased, strongly.  I like health care, ergo I like the party that has expanded health care.  I like the minimum wage, ergo I like the party that created the American minimum wage and have raised it 21 out of 23 times.  I care about the environment, ergo I like the party that acknowledges the science of climate change.  Hell yeah I'm biased, I'm biased the same way that a weight lifter is biased toward meals with lots of protein; if you want to build muscle, it won't help you to eat ten pounds of lettuce after a workout, or, in the case of Republicans, drinking bleach.   

As for the negatives, all of the candidates have them, but none have been a big enough deal for me to vote against my own best interests.  
  
Joe Biden said the words ""urban jungle?""  Don't care, he wants a $15/hr minimum wage, and the words ""urban jungle"" pale in comparison to Trump trying to postpone the election and blowing up the economy.    
  
Hillary Clinton once uttered ""super predator?""  Don't care, she wanted universal health care, and the words ""super predator"" pale in comparison to Trump raping his wife and promising to bomb civilians overseas.    
  
Barack Obama couldn't keep his promise about you keeping your doctor?  Care a little bit, but he still managed to give health insurance to 20 million uninsured Americans, ""If you like your doctor, you can keep them"" pales in comparison to Mitt Romney promising to repeal the ACA whole cloth.  
  
Obama mentioned people clinging to their guns and religion?  Don't care, he campaigned on rebuilding the economy and expanding health care, ""people clinging to their guns and religion"" pales in comparison to John McCain fucking ***joking*** about starting a war with Iran, not taking climate change seriously, and nominating an airhead for VP.  
  
You want to know why I didn't list negatives for the Democrats?  Because it's fucking trivial compared to the damage done by Republicans.  What am I supposed to get my panties in a knot about?  No, none of the Democrats in my lifetime have been perfect, none ever will be, no political candidate will ever be perfect because they're all humans, and humans are imperfect; that said, even *with* those imperfections, each of those Democratic candidates would have been better for my country than the Republican alternative was, I absolutely believe that.  
  
When Republicans acknowledge that climate change is a real threat, or that government spending is good for the economy, or that the minimum wage helps people, then maybe I'll consider voting for them, but right now and for the past forty years, no Republican has talked about taking our nation in the direction I want and we need our nation to go in.",,

&gt; I don't see any actual plan coming out of Biden's camp for accomplishing prison reform, free two year, or a minimum wage increase. until I see some concrete legislation on this I have zero faith Biden will expend political capital to get it done or not laiden the system down with so many austerity measures the programs become useless.

Those are his actual stated positions though. That is a significant difference - Trump's stated positions are terrible. Stating that you don't believe in Biden's actual positions seems like you're just trying to justify your belief that they're identical, in the face of actual evidence to the contrary.
 
&gt; Carbon taxes do nothing to fight the root causes of climate change, they don't even act as a speed bump and will do nothing to stop environmental catastrophe.

Carbon taxes make emitting CO2 more expensive. That will *absolutely* reduce emissions. It's not as good as we could do, but it's a hell of a lot better than Trump's support of coal and rolling back emissions/fuel economy standards.


&gt; His plan for expanding the aca is a joke that won't help an meaningful amount of people.
 
And again, any amount of expansion of the ACA is better than dismantling it. Hell, just restoring it to where it was under Obama would be an improvement from where we are now, much less where we would be under another 4 years of Trump.

No, it isn't perfect, but improvement is still a worthwhile goal. Again, our only two options are Trump and Biden at this point. One of them will (slightly) improve American healthcare, one will throw it in a fire and piss on the ashes. That seems like a pretty easy choice to me.
  
&gt; Given Biden's track record of deregulation and corporate servitude I can't see a Biden tax plan doing anything other than increasing the amount of money going to the top 1%.

As with above, this seems like you're just ignoring his stated positions because you've already decided you don't want to vote for him. However, he lays out his plan very clearly on his policy page: 

&gt; As President, Biden will roll back the Trump rate cut for the very wealthy and restore the 39.6% top rate...The Biden plan will assure those making over $1 million will pay the top rate on capital gains, doubling the capital gains tax rate on the super wealthy.

He wants to increase capital gains from 20% to 39.6% for income over $1MM, and also roll back the Trump reduction of the top tax bracket (39.6% is the same as the top bracket was under Obama). You could accuse him of lying I suppose, but even then, someone who tries to appeal to people who want increased taxes is preferable to someone who openly courts corporations (and that's taking the most cynical possible view).

1545,ihpeqrl,"Large swings in demand are hard to compensate for, especially with renewables. Not as much of an issue right now since most of our production is still fossil fuel based but if we ever want to have a mostly renewable grid then it’ll be quite a large issue. Even today only 33% is renewable and a pretty big challenge to balance.

Excess energy is completely uneconomical to store, exporting it is ideal but realistically places like the UK will have similar wind profiles to us so when we produce a lot so will neighbouring countries. We can waste it/dump it or curtail generators but that’s very uneconomical. Not in the numbers on a spreadsheet sense but in the massively inefficient use of resources sense.

The plan is to produce a massive excess of renewable energy. Having a high base load will help balance so if we do have to compensate with storage, we’ll have avenues to use that storage quickly without risking exceeding storage capacity, and will always have somewhere that needs a lot of energy (especially useful at night when it tends to be windiest). And swings in demand up to peak demand will be a smaller percentage of minimum demand if we have a lot of baseload.

There is the argument that lowering consumption is the only way to deal with climate change but shifting data centres to another country (which probably has a less green grid) doesn’t actually solve anything on that front. If you think no country should take it up then you better be willing to pick up a gun for some sort of socialist/eco-fascist revolution.

&gt; Global warming  
&gt; Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century, and most notably since the late 1970s, due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions since the industrial revolution. Worldwide since 1880, the average surface temperature has gone up by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980).

&gt; Climate change  
&gt; Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to Earth’s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, but also encompass changes such as sea level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme weather events.  
  
Climate change is the drive of the issue.  
Global warming can be considered as a side effect from climate change, but no, they are not ""the same thing"".

The history of French colonialism is pretty extensive and it continues today. Most former colonises are forced to make repayments for the benefits of colonialism along with a bunch of other ridiculous demands. France was heavily involved in the bombing of Libya in 2011 and further intervened in Mali to protect its interests. I have a friend who served in the French Foreign Legion. As he said (and its really no secret) they're just there to guard French mining corporations. The country runs on the resources it continues to steal from its former colonies.

The different fates of affluent and ordinary people (a distinction that correlates strongly with white/non-white) during and after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans gives us a preview. In the somewhat detached language of scholarly research—this from the June 2015 issue of Population and Environment—“Social inequality has been identified as an important contributor to increasing the vulnerability of communities.” 

&gt; We should abandon any magical thinking that pretends human nature and entrenched political/economic systems will change overnight and lead to global solidarity. But we can continue the difficult work for social justice and ecological sustainability simultaneously, not because we believe in fantasies of a world repaired, but because of the need to hold on to our humanity in a broken world.

The secondary reason is that Pete makes government process reform (voter rights, gerrymandering, DC statehood, politicization of SCOTUS, etc) a centerpiece of his campaign to a much greater extent than any other candidate, and I think those reforms are critical prerequisites for most of the more ambitious things we need to do on policy that directly affects people.

She really is the most [liberal senator in the US](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2019/senate/ideology), beating out even Sanders by one. So I'm overjoyed with the ticket right now.

But let's also be extremely clear here. Biden and Harris ***can't*** snap their fingers and change the world like liberals want, because we elect Presidents in this country, not kings. The very same constitutional mechanisms that are being used to keep Trump and his merry band of fascists from turning the US into a dictatorship, also kept Obama from really fixing things when he was President, and will do the same to Biden. It is not the desire of Democrats, but limits on our power, that force us into making incremental changes, frustrating as that is.

So not unless there is a cultural sea change in terms of political parties (which seems exceedingly unlikely) are we going to make massive changes. Further, when changes do happen, they will not come with an orgasm of vengeance and justice-porn against sociopaths. Instead, it just becomes the new normal. 

Let me give you an example. In the 1990s, it was just typical to use the word ""gay"" as an insult, which itself what a euphemism they themselves used for word ""homo"" and the epithet ""faggot"". The GOP won massively in 1994 by scaring the public into thinking that Democrats were going to (gasp) allow gay marriage. This is how Newt Gingrich came to power. ""Don't ask don't tell"" was a *reform*, considerably better than the military trying to entrap gay service personnel, which is what they did before. Even as late as 2004, Bush allowed the military to drum out badly needed gay Iranian service personnel who spoke Farsi and Arabic (and who were loyal specifically due to the way Muslims murder gays).  But then, slowly, scientists started showing findings that being ""gay"" wasn't a lifestyle or a communicable disease, and even Republican kids suddenly didn't care. As I put to them at the time, ""no skin off *your* nose"" right?

Global climate change will be attacked the same way. Not when evil people are made to go away, but when even evil people say ""I'm not stupid - hurricanes and flooding florida is bad - oh, and did you check out that sweet new Tesla model?"". (Oh, and when you get to be your dad's age, kids will be angrily frowning at you saying ""you actually RODE in carbon burning cars? How DARE you!"")

Lastly, I'm probably closer to your dad's age than yours, but it is difficult to overstate my anger. I'm more than mad at just the conservatives, I'm also insanely angry at the hate-filled left who seem bound and determined to make the nation and the world go to hell in the insane belief that this will cause a rebound to the neo-communism that the US public will never allow. Nader, the asshole, doing his best to help Bush become President. The Bernie-bros doing their best to help Trump.

1612,dkc00y5,"&gt;Now, the case for Swearingen. It's worth noting that Bernie Sanders won all 55 counties in West Virginia in the 2016 presidential primaries, and he won the whole state by 15 percentage points. It's generally assumed that any non-incumbent Democrat would get mauled in the ruby-red state, since Trump won it by 41.7 percentage points. However, who's to say that someone who runs on a platform of single-payer health care and helping the environment (in one of the most polluted states in the nation, mind you), can't win?

This is largely because of cross-over voting.  We knew this, even Sanders' camp acknowledged this.  Trump had his primary in the bag and GOP voters wanted to run against Bernie over Hillary.  Furthermore, as a Ruby Red state, winning over GOP voters is more important than winning the far left.

&gt;The reason Trump won so bigly in WV was because he made it clear that he had a plan. Hillary didn't. Could Bernie have won the state? It's very much possible, since Trump flat-out denies climate change.

Lol.  What plan? To ""Make America Great Again""?  To bring back coal jobs by doing ?????  Hillary, on the other hand, had an entire economic revitalization plan targeted for Appalachia, sending billions of dollars their way and converting their economy to center on modern technology like Green Energy.   That was all Hillary talked about in that region.

Trump won because West Virginia wanted coal jobs back and would only vote for someone who promised those jobs back. ",,

3) The schedule also messed up in that it doesn't maximize the number of viewers reached. One is during the Xmas holiday season. One is Sunday Night during MLK weekend. One is the night of playoffs.

4) Weeknight viewers far exceed weekend viewers. The GOP put most of their debates on weeknights. The Dems put 1.

The environment should be preserved because it has value to people. When you're destroying someone's livelihood, and violating their property rights, it's hard to argue that the value of what you're preserving outweighs the damage you're doing. The same thing goes for climate change. The most likely estimates from scientists are not doomsday scenarios but peg the cost of climate change at taking us from being something like ~2.6x richer in 2100 (without climate change) to only being ~2.5x richer (after the impact of climate change and related deadweight costs).

1628,dc96in4,"Nonlinear optics.

I am a pretty bad Christian. I make it to church maybe once a year, and I routinely question the existence of God, and and am not very good and holding to the ethical teachings. So personally I feel no need to reconcile either. I do see stand alone value in the ethical teachings, so that aspect appeals and motivates me to be a better human. 

There have been a number of scientists who have pondered these issues at length (Bacon comes to mind), and typically the orderly universe is perceived to be the result of a divine hand. My relativity teacher in grad school marveled at the symmetry of the physics of the universe, and for him it reaffirmed his faith. I know Einstein was troubled by quantum mechanics (God does not play dice with the universe). What I find interesting is how the old Greeks firmly believed celestial bodies had to be spheres or move in circular paths, as the symmetry of a perfect circle was divine and there was an expectation of the heavens being of perfection. Early mechanical models of orbital motion did not use elliptical paths, but instead followed the more complex circles and epicircles construction of the Greeks, which worked well enough.

I think if you believe in an omnipotent being, and you realize our brains are finite, then you must understand there will be some things our creator does that may be beyond our understanding. Imagine yourself as a dog trying to puzzle out why people spend so much time staring at a box with moving light pictures. This is where we stand if there is indeed an omnipotent creator. 

So I am a pretty bad person to ask about religious faith. Faith for me comes from repetition of occurrence. Behavior repeats in reliable patterns that give you faith in the model that explains those patterns. Religious faith eludes me many times because by training I am so very skeptical, as that skepticism hones the quality of my research. I have had a few subjective religious experiences that at the time made me firmly convinced of the divine, and then as time passed, doubt reasserted itself. I do not feel really bad about this, because if I was designed by a creator to be skeptical then it is my purpose to question, and I am as I am intended.

The left likes to go to big oil = skepticism on climate science. But I would like to point out that most of the skeptics are not wealthy, nor are they funded to refute climate change, and frequently put their own careers at risk by tackling the gorilla of climate change. What tends to motivate them is the fact that their science has been politicized, and the censorship and data fudging and dishonesty of the alarmists do real damage to the integrity of science. They do this out of a love for science, receive no compensation for doing so, and typically are vilified. I have seen a few guys in the skeptic community linked to oil, but most who I read are not.

Contrast this with those who get funded to study climate change. Almost all of them get funded by government funding streams. I am sure you are familiar with the fact that the greater the severity of the problem, the greater the likelihood of funding. So there is direct interest in overstating the severity of gradual warming in order to rise above other competing research grants in the funding process.",,

1633,db7rpw9,"It's a bummer to me that you don't believe the science behind it. I'm not sure how far removed you are from environmental sciences, but I don't think there is much debate anymore.  Maybe at one point there was more controversy.  I'm a fan of NASA's data sets, and their resources http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/, if you're interested.  The scientific community, as a whole, is pretty concrete on the matter these days (there will always be outliers, but the general consensus at least).

&gt;Our Earth has natural buffering mechansims (such as the ocean and plantlife) to remove extra CO2 from the atmosphere.

You're absolutely right, that the earth has natural buffering agents against greenhouse gases, but they are limited in their capacity.  Oceans are acidifying, slowly but surely, over the last several decades (CO2 dissolved in water makes it acidic).  This is thought to be what's causing the coral bleaching effects in the great barrier reef, especially.  Coral, as it turns out, is super pH sensitive.  I think what is most disconcerting is that until 50 or 60 years ago, the earth hasn't seen CO2 levels above 300ppm in hundreds of thousands of years.  It's over 400ppm these days, and still rising drastically.  If nothing else, we should be paying attention to it and making every damn effort to figure out what that means for us.

&gt;You'll find that most of the highest production/evolutionary eras of humankind have occurred when the climate was hot and people didn't have to work so hard to make food and keep warm

I'm not sure I understand your point.  Most of mankind's history has been slooooww and steady, except for the last 10-12k years or so...basically since the last ice age, where the planet has held an extraordinarily constant temperature, relative to times prior.  If you trust Wiki, check this link out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_temperature_record#Late_Proterozoic_ice_ages.  Basically, the last 10-12k years the temperature has been outstandingly stable, arguably one of the biggest reasons we've been so successful as a species during this time.  I think stability has been a bigger factor than warm vs. cold, because you don't have to adapt as a species constantly.

On the topic of ice cores, I actually had the privilege of working with someone who spent 2 years in the antarctic doing exactly what you stated (who randomly switched fields because he wanted to study malaria...interesting guy).  From my conversations with him, it sounds like core sample analysis is good clean science, and that science tells us a lot.  Lots of chemistry and geology to test exactly what was going on in the world.  Let's be real, we don't have a better way of doing it, so I trust the data above anything else.


I'm with you that I don't think we're going to see the earth heat up by 20 degrees or anything like that.  I do worry that we'll lose some species though, which would be a shame.  I think one of the biggest things we should worry about is crop sustainability.  If the bread baskets (Russia, Canada, plains of US, etc) of the world heat up 3 or 4 degrees and start getting less rain, for example, that's a tremendous problem.  Acidification of the ocean could also have big effects on global fisheries.  We might not cook ourselves, but we might starve ourselves, which I think is a far more likely problem.  The fact of the matter is, we don't know exactly what will happen.  Man-made or not (and I'm still relatively sure that a substantial portion is man-made), it's a problem, and it's foolish, in my opinion, to not try to deal with it.  

I guess one thing I don't understand from your viewpoint is the ""hoax"" thing.  What do agencies such as NASA and the department of defense, not to mention most of the developed world, have to gain by this ""hoax?""  I mean, even the big oil companies are starting to shift.  The guy Trump just appointed as S.o.S. is Exxon Mobile's CEO.  Don't like the pick, personally, but curiously, he supports the Paris Agreements on climate change.  It's worth noting, at least.

So, sorry that I am not a 'true believer' and that I question claims as serious as those made by the climate change advocates.... The fact of the matter is that you have lied in the past in order to push your true agenda so now I am even more skeptical.

Unlike all of the faggot liberals that live in my neighborhood of The Highlands, Denver that drive land rovers, audis, etc... and live in shit-quality modern construction condos that now stand where perfectly good 80 year old homes once stood because you have to remain relevant in your late 30's.

Iraqi rivers are brackish already by the time they reach Kufa and kut . Desalination is needed for half of iraqs population at the minimum.

Iraq needs to utilise its labour, local materials and an investment in manufacturing capacity to pivot towards a system of solar power,  that is enormous (200GW plus installed) and use that power for everything from desalination to operating irrigation pumps, to powering the factories that make membranes, solar panels and inverters... tp making the pumps and pipes that can be used to forest up the western desert  and dramatically improve our climate.

Ah, but we haven't explored the entire universe yet, you argue?  Well to that I retort that we likewise are woefully short of exploring the innumerable factors influencing climate change.  We didn't even realize there were thermal vents all over the sea floor until the 1970s and didn't map most of them until the 2000's.  We're just now finding out there are vents under the sea ice near the north pole and I'm sure we'll discover the same near the south given Mt. Erebus is the world's foremost bubbling cauldron of magma (according to Attenborough in Planet Earth II).  

How can we accurately model climate change without monitoring the output of these massive heat generators that surely contribute significantly to oceanic warming?  Do we have sensors on all these vents to measure fluctuations in output?  Is it not at least plausible, especially given the spate of massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions of late (which surely aren't mankind's fault), that tectonic forces might likewise be increasing output from these vents?  

I'm not here to refute AGW; surely we're contributing since we burn a shitload of things and every city is solar heat sink.  What I'm arguing is that, until we can account for FAR more inputs into climate change (if not all since that's nigh impossible), then we should not slam the door shut on debate simply because the vast majority of climate scientists agree on the matter.  

No new Einstein has yet emerged to present a mathematical formula provinig AGW and until then, it remains just a theory.  Consider as well that climate scientists may be chasing the assumption of AGW because were they to *disprove* it, they'd be out of work.  Could that be why they consider their *consensus* to be equivalent to a *fact* just as the great scientific minds half a millennium ago all agreed that the world was flat?  Might they have selfish reasons for abandoning the scientific method short of presenting mathematical *proof*?

I repeat again that humanity certainly are contributing to climate change since we are (*arguably* significant) factors in this system.  Do we know for a fact though that earth has no mechanism for recovering from AGW and that we will assuredly render ourselves Venutians in short order as climatologists warn?  How can we be certain of that fate given that we have no prior history of AGW to examine in ice cores or soil samples?  What we do know is that in the past, earth was both much warmer and much colder and yet here we are.  Maybe despite the numerous meteor impacts, solar events and tectonic upheavals, earth has a mechanism to return to equilibrium even if we ""burn this mother down"".

Sure, we're factors influencing climate change to some extent - of that nearly everyone agrees.  The real question though is whether the harm to our existence is greater if we shut down the machinery that keeps us fed, warmed and sheltered or if we might be better off adapting to the changes we do (or perhaps don't) inflict on the climate?  

We build bunkers and seed vaults for fear of nuclear armageddon; why not act similarly to prepare for the possibility of oceans rising instead of trying to stop it?  Yes I know half the world lives near sea level and moving them would be a herculean effort, but it's still something we can *definitely* achieve whereas many climatologists seem to think we're past the point of no return to halt AGW.

&gt; Germany&amp;#039;s coalition government has reached an agreement on a climate change action plan which involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050, a spokesperson said on Friday.

&gt; The plan, which will require German industry to reduce its CO2 emission by a fifth by 2030, and Germany&amp;#039;s energy sector to reduce emissions by almost a half, will be reviewed in 2018 with a view to its impact on jobs and society.

&gt; The president of the Association of German Industry criticised the action plan : &amp;quot;In order for [German] climate policy to set the standard around the world, it has to be manageable for businesses and allow them to remain competitive,&amp;quot; Ulrich Grillo said.

1688,hhhu573,"&gt;Brazil and Argentina, two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world, argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Typical.  From a [previous comment:](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/p9wdlq/Time_for_a_cow_tax%3F_Buried_in_UN_report_is_bad_news_about_climate_impact_of_factory_farms/ha3ugrs/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)

The reasons animal agriculture hasn't had to face the massive environmental regulation that it's long overdue for are lobbying and the public's lack of will to change habits.

Our current consumption of animal products is a major contributor to climate change,[\[1\]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987) and climate change in turn is a risk to food security and human health.[\[2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/)  Recognizing this fact, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) decided to consider sustainability in their 2015 report to the USDA, stating that:

&gt;...a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet. This pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns, including the Healthy U.S.-style Pattern, the Healthy Mediterranean-style Pattern, and the Healthy Vegetarian Pattern. All of these dietary patterns are aligned with lower environmental impacts and provide options that can be adopted by the U.S. population.[\[3\]](https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/previous-dietary-guidelines/2015/advisory-report)

In response, industry associations lobbied Senators to remove sustainability as a consideration from the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs).  In the end, the animal agriculture industry was successful in preventing sustainability's consideration in the 2015 DGAs, despite public support for its inclusion.[\[4\]](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/2015-dietary-guidelines-217438)[\[5\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

In the EU, two industry associations (UECBV &amp; CLITRAVI) lobbied in 2012 to become leading stakeholders in a public-private partnership coordinated by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to assess the best way to estimate the environmental performance of EU livestock.  In 2014, the UECBV got onto a project with the EU Commission for the ""development of a harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint"" of meat products.\[6\]  What happened with these environmental projects?

&gt;At the end of 2019 no scientific output had emerged from any of the previous partnerships beyond press releases and memorandums of positions.  In short, the strategy followed seems to merely replicate a common pattern: make great efforts to become a privileged partner in discussions on what has to be changed in order to prevent such change as much as possible by forcing one's narrative and interests.[\[7\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

The UN, despite recognizing as early as 2006 that the animal agriculture industry was a major source of anthropogenic GHG emissions,[\[8\]](http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm) didn't explicitly recommend plant-based diets as a solution until their 2019 report.[\[9\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/)  Even then, when given the opportunity to voice the findings of his report, the co-chair's message was weak:

&gt;We don’t want to tell people what to eat ... but it would indeed be beneficial, for both climate and human health, if people in many rich countries consumed less meat, and if politics would create appropriate incentives to that effect.[\[10\]](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-02409-7)

It doesn't exactly communicate the magnitude and urgency of the issue.

Even NGOs with goals that would clearly benefit from a reduction in our consumption of animal products - such as Greenpeace, Sierra Club, or the World Wildlife Fund - do not explicitly oppose animal agriculture.  Why not?

&gt;In an interview about the launching of his documentary *An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power*, \[Al\] Gore was asked why he did not put more emphasis on eating habits and on the consumption of animal products.  Gore, who according to himself has been vegan since 2012, provided two reasons for this: first, personal habits are very difficult to change and, second, any emphasis on animal products could be seen as an attack on the animal agriculture and food industry.  That is, he recognised that he did not emphasise *meat*\-eating so as to not bother big business and citizens.  We can infer from this that green NGOs and advocates are strongly reluctant to send messages that may expose the contradictions of society probably out of fear of losing support, which could severly damage their finances.  Thus, their denial is also essentially economically oriented.[\[7\]](https://sydneyuniversitypress.com.au/products/128398)

So there are a few reasons nobody is doing anything about animal agriculture when it comes to climate change.  Politicians are worried their constituents will get pissed off (especially if their district is a big producer of animal products) and not vote for them.  People don't want to change their habits.  Organizations that should be sounding the alarm are afraid of losing support, either financial or otherwise, by opposing animal agriculture.  And there is a very aggressive animal agriculture lobby that has been highly successful at running interference.

Edit: Third, /u/MasterCXDebaterTOCez post a pdf that explains this better than I have and reminded me that I used that pdf to teach myself when I was a novice.

For the purposes of this post, I'm going to assume you know the basics like speech times and the resolution, if not I would be more than happy to explain. I am also assuming you have debated before in a different form of debate (this one could definitely be wrong, so correct me if necessary)

Here is some of the slang, in no particular order.

Both

Impact-Generally, this is something bad that could happen. This ranges from Climate Change to nuclear war to smaller impacts like poverty.

Terminal Impact- Why is the the Impact bad? Generally the terminal impact is extinction. For smaller impacts, the Terminal impact evidence will just describe how many people might die/suffer from the impact.

SQ or squo-Short for Status Quo or the world as it currently is without the plan being considered

Theory-Theory arguments are arguments concerning nonexistent 'rules of debate'. These are not officcal rules per say, but the arguer will try to prove that following this rule would benefit debaters in some way. For example a theory argument might say that bringing up new arguments in the 2NR is abusive for the affirmative and should not be 'allowed' by the judge.

Affirmative

Aff-Shortening of affirmative

Plan text- This is the textual sentence describing a theoretical policy that the aff team advocates for.

SHITS or stock issues-These are the 5 essential parts of the affirmative.

Significance/Harms- The first 2 of this SHITS. These describe a problem that (hopefully) the plan will try to solve.

Inherency- The next of the SHITS. Inherency evidence just says the plan isn't already happening. Some 1ACs won't need to have a specific piece of evidence for it, but they will still need to not be already present in the status quo

Topicality- The next of the SHITS. Topicality is just a question of whether the plan fits under the resolution. Most affs wont explicitly say they are topical, and will usually assume they are. MOst of the time topicality or T arguments will be brought up the negative team.

Solvency- This is the last of the SHITS- Solvency evidence states that the Affirmative can fix the problems outlined in the S/H. 

However, the SHITS model is generally considered out of date. Most affirmatives will have generally a Solvency Contention and 1 more or more Advantages

Advantage-A broad definition of an Advantage is a contention outline a specific problem the affirmative solves. An advantage contains both solvency just for that specific problem and evidence for the impact of that problem. 

Negative

/u/sick_burn_bro has covered most of the neg arguments pretty well, so read his post below this one.

Disadvantage- Disadvantages are pretty similar to advantages, however some would say they are the reverse. They are made up Links, Internal Links (as needed), Uniqueness, and Impacts (which are all described in /u/sick_burn_bro)

On-case Arguments- These are smaller arguments made up of 1 or 2 pieces of evidence that directly apply to the aff case. These are usually separated into 2 categories: Offensive and Defensive.

Offensive On-case Arguments- Offensive arguments say that the affirmative makes something WORSE than the status quo. These are generally referred to as turns. For example, if they aff solves Climate Change, then a turn might be that Climate Change is actually good or that the affirmative makes climate change worse.

Defensive On Case Arguments -Defensive case arguments say that the affirmative does not make things better than the SQ. For example, going back to the Climate Change example, a defensive argument might be that there is no impact to climate change and thus solving climate change is pointless and is not beneficial.

Off-Case Arguments-These are arguments that are flowed separately. These are Disadvantages, Kritik, T, Counterplans, and (negative's) theory arguments.

Thanks for sending the infograph link. The fact that climate is prone to change is evidenced by fact. I don't dispute the climate can change and it likely is changing as we speak.  (nb: I would probably be a bit more cautious, though, about speculations regarding the expected future trajectory of global temp.s, the extent of the role played in this process by humans, and what its eventual impact might be - given the several, several, several predictions that have proven woefully inaccurate on this historically.)

Anyway, back to bushfires: even the graph shows that the current average global temperature is about the same as the Holocene climate optimum noted throughout 3000-8000 BCE. How can we infer from that that the current bushfires ergo must be unprecedented?

Finally, I have no doubt that humanity and its welcome advance on this planet created substantial change for many species and augured an anthropocene era.
But perhaps the most pernicious impact us humans had on severity of bushfires has been in a much, much more direct way?: https://www.smh.com.au/national/arson-mischief-and-recklessness-87-per-cent-of-fires-are-man-made-20191117-p53bcl.html",,

1705,daztcd8,"I don't think we're doing science correctly if we start with a conclusion and then guide investigation to reach that conclusion. This is what I believe is happening with man-made Climate Change. 

Consensus is not scientific. Original theories have 0% consensus but this doesn't affect the theory in the least. Same can be said for a theory with 97% or whatever consensus but doesn't stand up to scientific rigor and has no predictive power.

I don't know 'better' than 'the scientists.' I agree with them about climate change. I know about climate change, I know it's warmer, and I agree to that extent. I don't know that it's human-caused and there's more evidence to suggest that it's not. 

For example, do you know about the Little Ice Age? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age

It started in the middle ages and ended almost 200 years ago. Glaciers started receding as temps and CO2 levels rose. This was decades before the Industrial Revolution was underway. Zero powerplants, no lightbulbs etc. By the time global industrialization really took off, in the 50's, more than 70% of this glacial melt had happened.

Following the data, watching the trend, we have a simple natural explanation for climate change that brings us to today.

Climate Change is the attempt to create panic in order to advance political causes. It uses data models to scare people. We've seen how when the models don't match the observed data, they change the models. If a model with 2x the CO2 doesn't cause enough catastrophe, then there's a model with 4x CO2 that will. 

And even just reviewing the datasets, there's consensus... That there's no change.

https://climatism.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/six-different-data-sets-global-temp.gif?w=590&amp;h=440

To put it bluntly regardless of truth or untruth, lies, propaganda, putin-bots or whatever it's simply the wrong way to go.

To quote one political theorist (Christopher Lasch):

&gt;What democracy requires is vigorous public debate, not information. Of course, it needs information too, but the kind of information it needs can be generated only by debate. We do not know what we need to know until we ask the right questions, and we can identify the right questions only by subjecting our own ideas about the world to the test of public controversy. Information, usually seen as the precondition of debate, is better understood as its byproduct. When we get into arguments that focus and fully engage our attention, we become avid seekers of relevant information. Otherwise we take in information passively -if we take it in at all.",,

So let's say there's a topic where we have convincing scientific evidence that something is happening, like climate change, and a portion of the country refuses to acknowledge that large body of scientific evidence and instead denies the existence of said climate change.

Under the circumstances, denying climate change arguably is very stupid when you consider just how much evidence there is to support it and the fact that the countervailing ""evidence"" largely consists of things like ""it was really cold today in January, therefore climate change isn't real."" So if someone points out how stupid it is to ignore that evidence, that would be ""telling it like it is,"" right? The alternative is to coddle people who deny a large body of scientific evidence based on their gut feeling by telling them that their viewpoint is ""valid."" But that would be the height of PC culture gone mad, because we would be telling people who are simply flat out wrong based on the scientific evidence that their wrong viewpoint is somehow valid and should be respected.

But I hope we can agree that in the intervening 27 years, advances may have been made, both in the accuracy of measuring sea level due to technological advances and a better understanding of the Oceans themselves.  Having said that, let's quote the actual 1990 report.  From the Executive Summary:

&gt;For the IPCC Business-as-Usual Scenario at year 2030 global-mean seal level is 8 - 29cm higher than today, with a best-estimate of 18cm.  At the year 2070, the rise is 21 - 71cm, with a best-estimate of 44cm.

So that's a pretty big range, between 8 and 29 cm.  And that's for 2030, not for 2017.  And it was a prediction made more than 27 years ago.  You acknowledge that sea level rise according to NOAA is 5.8cm higher than 1993.  Further, your link states,

&gt;Sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year

Now, I don't know if NOAA believes that was the rate of rise in 1990 - 1993.  But assuming it was about that, if you add 3 years x 1/8 in to the 2.3 in that NOAA has already measured - you get 2.975 in. or 7.56cm. . . in 2017.  That seem pretty damn close to the prediction of 8 - 29cm by 2030.  And we still have 13 more years to go. . .  Do you disagree with that?

So given those numbers, I'm not seeing why you have a problem with the accuracy of the 1990 prediction on sea level.  I won't even go into how they underestimated sea level rise in the 3rd Assessment Report (2001).


&gt;The ""climate change"" conversation no longer even involves sea levels.

I'm not sure why you think this is the case.  The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2013/2014) also has a large section on sea level rise as part of Working Group I (Chapter 11).  And I have not heard anything about omitting the topic in the Sixth assessment, which won't be finalized until 2021.
&gt; a large part of the climate change conversation was how heat was getting trapped in the earth due to increased levels of CO2. There was a consensus that increased levels would lead to less heat being radiated into space. However would not the data from the ERBE satellite indicate otherwise?

I'm not sure why you think a hotter planet would radiate less heat into space. . . Think about if you had two cups of coffee, one in an insulated thermos, the other in a paper cup.

Obviously the one in the thermos radiates less heat than the one in the cup.  But now let's imagine you could add heat to the coffee from inside each container.  Which coffee is going to get hotter?  The one in the thermos, or the one in the paper cup?

Both the thermos and the paper cup are going to radiate more heat than before.  But the coffee in the thermos is retaining more of the heat in the coffee.

Thats based on projections first of all. Predicting the economy is a bit like predicting the weather, based on sound science, understanding, and sophisticated statistical modelling by smart people....

However its not really good more than ten days out in a weather forecast, Its similar with economics. Those projections aren't useless, but if they were rock solid then someone would have become the next billionaire by betting on the ""reliable"" projections. 


Listen, My point is two fold...


1. No matter which way you slice it, per capita, total national emissions, or GHG emissions per dollar of GDP, the U.S is doing much better and is trending down over time.



2. You can't have the conversation about reducing emissions without also talking about living standards and economic growth going forward.


Most environmentalists I see talk about this issue completely write that off. I assume because they often overlap with the anti consumerist crowds and the anti capitalist crowds.

You may think thats fine in rich countries like the U.S or in Europe, where you personally feel people live to well as it is, But what about the poor subsitence farmer in Africa? Or Latin America? Or India?

You're going to tell them they can't use cheap fossil fuels to raise the comfort level of them and their families?


Seems awfully paternalistic to suggest such a thing, [Which as it turns out](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/obama-planet-will-boil-over-if-young-africans-are-allowed-cars-air-conditioning-big) is something our last president suggested to Africans in a visit there.

I thinks its bogus to hold people in rich countries to some lower standard of living, let alone the poorest people in the world.


Whats needed here is an acknowledgment of several things by the environmentalist side.

1. Markets are a huge part of the efficiency gains, It pays to reduce your costs whether thats a household budget or a businesses bottom line. Profit motive works well here.

2. We shouldn't hold poor people in developing countries from rising up, people are every bit as important as the environment, the concerns need to be balanced.

3. The real way forward on this issue is technology advancement, for example economically competitive Fusion would be a massive breakthrough. The main byproduct is to light for Earths Gravity to hold permanently so it floats into space on its own (Helium Gas), There is no chance of a meltdown, One potential fuel source is Ocean Water (hypothetically enough to power earth at current needs for millions of years).


Instead right now we have Environmentalists who allegedly care about science, yet support renewable energy sources that contribute to climate change by various other means (Solar = Alberto change, Wind = Heat and moisture dispersal interrupted in lower atmosphere).",,

1751,ddxwxgk,"I am not sure that my solution would be acceptable to either establishment/moderate centrists or to Bannon's alt right, unfortunately. :/

Let's pretend I'm made dictator of the United States with free reign to do whatever I'd like.  I know it's a bit fantastical, so I hope you'll indulge me.  Here are the choices I'd make, in order:

1. Immediate universal healthcare, likely through a public option.  Massive upgrades and investment in medical supplies and personnel.  Lots of construction of new hospitals and clinics.  Particularly I'd like to send medical vans door-to-door in rural areas for health and wellness checks (mandatory for children, optional for adults) and dramatically increase access to clinics in cities.  All doctor-prescribed medicine is free through the public option, and pharma prices are negotiated (or let's be real, if I were dictator, set) by the government.  This greatly increases demand for doctors, nurses, other healthcare professionals, as well as construction, medical research and technology, etc.
2. Indefinite free tuition for public universities (you can attend for free as long as you'd like).  Understaffed and essential professions like medicine and education would pay people to attend, although rigor would increase as often as possible.  Pork, administrative fees, and wasteful ""show off"" facilities are heavily restricted.  Additionally, massive investment in head start programs and K-12 education.  Essentially I'd like to move as many people as possible out of the workforce, and this incentivizes them to stay in school (also increases demand for teachers, professors, etc.).
3. Massive investment into infrastructure.  New roads, bridges, public transportation, water and sanitation, public parks, green homes and offices, green energy production, national parks, fast and reliable fiber internet, public wi-fi and charging facilities, disaster prevention, and so on.  Lots of new construction and logistics jobs.
4. The following changes to taxes and income:

* zero corporate income tax
* abolish minimum wage
* close all tax loopholes for the wealthy
* very high tax rate on the wealthy (equivalent to historical highs in terms of real tax)
* tax capital gains equivalent to other forms of income
* government subsidy for automating facilities
* study and implement cuts to all waste in the defense department
* end subsidies to oil companies and other industries antithetical to the long-term prosperity of the American people
* tax on capital (equipment, facilities, etc.)
* increase property taxes, particularly for corporate use
* tax public goods/facilities if industry is using them (air, water, etc.)
* tax on pollution (carbon taxes etc.) and other undesirable effects of industry
* implement universal basic income

5\. Investment in research about combatting the effects of climate change, space exploration, medical advances, A.I. advances (particularly ethics and philosophical concerns), human psychology and mental health...basically just lots of science research.

6\. Complete overhaul of criminal justice system.  All drugs are legalized.  Investment in healthcare includes public outreach and treatment for addicts.  Mandatory body cams.  Corruption rooted out and eliminated.  Strong emphasis on community policing and restoring relations and understanding between the police and the communities they serve.  Psychological evaluation and assistance for police officers (sociopaths would be fired or moved to non-dangerous positions, those with strong negative biases or other treatable psychological conditions would enter treatment).  Ban private prisons.  Much greater focus on rehabilitation in prison.  More research into the causes of crime and preventative measures.

***

If I were not actually a dictator, I would also want amendments passed to get money out of politics, implement a fair vote system (ranked choice voting for instance), abolish the electoral college, pass reforms on political parties (they would no longer be considered private organizations and would have to legally abide by election rules), and so on.  As I'm a dictator in this scenario, however, I suppose the point is moot.

Serious question. People act like this is a death knell for NASA and publicly funded exploration, research and development. It is not. Frankly hitting Musk on being an entrepreneur in space is only working to hamper the goal of having a normal economy outside of this blue dot of ours. 

NASA will always be a regulating body. NASA will always be developing on the edge of science and exploration. They will always be there to lead. 

Musk and SpaceX are simply following where NASA has already gone. If anything all those who dreamed of ""the future"" should be happy because this is progress. It gives NASA a goal beyond low earth orbit. 

SpaceX is also not hampered by corrupt politicians paid off by the oil and mineral industry. SpaceX can't have their budget yanked by corrupt congress critters whose donors bottom line depend on not seeing the effects of climate change and being dependent upon fossil fuels. 

The future is electromagnetic. We are still limited by giant rockets on volume and weight heavy fuels. If anything, Musk has set up a venture and collection of companies that will propel the species beyond this. Solar panels, industrial scallable battery technology, and space logistics. That is what SpaceX really is - a logistics platform. The trucking industry of space. 

Who wants to see electric rockets powered by modular solar batteries that can be hot swapped on demand and charged in low earth orbit? That is what SpaceX aims for. Thus the electric car in space. 

We should be happy for that. This frees up NASA to go bolder, and lead the way even further. 

NASA's SLS and Orion program are coming up. That is a real Mars and Moon colonization vehicle. NASA isn't dying - it is evolving.

Now who wants to see mining space rocks for minerals?
[We got private industry developing that too.](https://deepspaceindustries.com/)

One of the main factors we fund the crap out of the military and not NASA is because bribery and corruption are legal in this country. Those who are the power brokers and decision makers are heavily influenced by keeping us on the path of oil and scarce minerals. 

This is also a component of why crypto coins are taking off and becoming more mainstream. Scarcity of something needs to replace gold before we collapse the gold market and send the world economy to hell. ""digital gold"" = ""space bucks""

For centuries wars have been fought over billionaires pissing match for control of resources. What is going to happen to the minerals market once the golden nugget is found in space? What happens when we find a space rock that contains half the world's gold? What happens when we start mining the moon and [Titanium becomes as plentiful as copper?](https://www.space.com/13247-moon-map-lunar-titanium.html) That is the serious reason why there haven't been moon bases yet. 

This is the motive why we fund wars and not space exploration. This is why private industry has to lead the way right now. **Because our political forces are corrupted to absolute hell by greedy bastards whose worth depends on the status quo and refuse to evolve when they very much have the ability to do so.** They just don't want to sink money in doing so because even if they do, and they still will be rich, they are psychopathic greedy bastards that faint and have epic childish tantrums if a single penny doesn't turn a profit. 

Now if you want to discuss Musk's labor practices that is another thing all together. We can urge Elon to unionize and treat his workers better, and fairer.

1771,dp6bdsr,"First, I agree with you about the left frequently being condescending. I'm fairly liberal but I have more family members that are Republican than Democrat and virtually everyone I work with is an enthusiastic Republican. I frequently find myself disputing comments that say stuff like 'all Republicans are racists'. It's a caricature. 

I do have to say I see this a lot with people that associate only with like-minded people. Some of my Republican friends seriously believe that elite Democrats hate America and have an agenda to lower its standing in the world and make it a socialist hellhole. They understand the average Democrat might be a nice guy, but they're seriously convinced those people are just being duped by the evil George Soros's of the world. My liberal-bubble family members tend to believe that all Republicans are either ignorant knuckle-draggers or moneyed elites out to screw the common man.  It's easy to believe the worst of the other side when you isolate yourself from them, whether you're Democrat or Republican.

&gt; However, so is the left wing media which is basically every station but fox.

I consume a pretty wide variety of news media. Stuff like Thinkprogress.org and shareblue.org are obviously biased, even when they report something accurately they'll often interject little attacks just to emphasize their contempt. Slate and the New Yorker have some good stuff but it's fair to label them liberal. MSNBC, liberal although its parent company NBC's news really isn't. 

But I have to say that the BBC and NPR are mostly unbiased. The New York Times and Washington Post both have excellent journalistic standards. It wouldn't surprise me if they have a disproportionately Democrat-leaning set of reporters but it usually doesn't come through in their reporting because a) they source carefully, and b) have editorial standards regarding tone. 

I'll also add that with any news service you have to be careful whether you're reading something that comes out of the news department, which has one set of standards, versus an editorial or opinion piece, which have much lower standards in terms of fact checking and they're allowed to express strong personal opinions. Like Paul Krugman in the NY Times is a Nobel-winning economist. So he's as high an authority as it gets when writing on economics, but he's also a liberal and he unabashedly advocates various liberal policies -- and his column is very intentionally in the Opinion section. 

It's easy to see a column like his and figure the entire paper is in the bag for the Democrats, but it's really not true. Their news department strives to not take sides. [Check out this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html) reporting the then-breaking news that the Democrats paid for the Steele dossier. To me that looks like solid reporting even though it's making the Democrats look bad. 

Anyway back to your point, I agree with much of it. Like the left on student campuses are getting ridiculous; they believe in free speech as long as they agree with you, but they'll prevent you from speaking if they disagree. WTF. And the ideas of trigger speech, microaggressions, cultural appropriation and safe spaces are all toxic. 

There's a lot wrong with the left. But overall based on just policies, I find myself unable to side with Republicans on key issues that are very important to me. Like I am pro life, cutting taxes on the rich does not fuel the ""job creators"", I strongly believe in the global scientific consensus on climate change, and I'm deeply concerned about the size of the deficit -- something that Republicans are worried about when there is a Democrat in the White House, then happily blow up when they control things. The Bush tax cuts blew up the deficit, the entire Iraq War was funded via emergency funding so they didn't have to raise taxes to pay for it, and now they're working on another deficit-busting tax cut bill.

If we import those resources or batteries, where did the country we purchase from get those resources to sell or make the batteries the US would need to purchase for all those EVs? And how are you proposing to build the infrastructure to support charging all those EVs across the US roadways? What will you need to build a charging station in the middle of nowhere on say.. I-70 or I-80 or I-40? Are people going to be limited on routes designated by this charging port infrastructure you are proposing? Which makes it easier for you to monitor and track, by the way.

So, Mr. Butthurt, are you saying that you support mining, drilling, and fracking as long as its not done in the US...because of climate change...and the US has to do our part? Does it help the climate and the environment if other countries continue to drill, mine, frack, and process all the resources to sell/trade to the US?",,

1780,e5c1r0m,"&gt; The point about arsonists and negligence is well-taken, and I don't know how many that accounts for of the fires on this map:
&gt; https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2018/fire-tracker/

All three of teh ones that aren't fully contained as of this post. The holy fire was actually started by a resident in the area. Every house in that canyon (all ~100 year old historical sites) burned down EXCEPT ONE, the house that the arsonist resided in. The other fires I believe started from natural causes but aronsist set new ones downstream that eventually merged to join them. 

&gt; I think it's mostly down to a combination fire 'overmanagement' as /u/amaxen mentioned (70+ years of stamping out every fire as quickly as possible rather than letting it run its course), and reduced or changed rainfall patterns (e.g., a big storm that drops 5"" of rain in 24 hours vs smaller storms that drop that over the course of a week). Whether the latter is a result of California entering another 'super dry' period as has been seen in the geological record, or a result of anthropogenic climate change is matter of valid debate, but anthropogenic climate change shouldn't be dismissed out of hand.

Forests aren't being 'overmanaged' anymore. Parks services and others are doing things like authorizing thinning out highly at-risk forests, allowing dead or about-to-die trees to be cut and sold as cheap lumber, etc. And at least on federally controlled lands, like the Marine bases, techniques like backburning (intentionally doing controlled burn to kill off things like weeds without killing all the trees) are used successfully. 

I'm not dismissing ACG out of hand, nor do am I opposed to spending significant political capital to address ACG, I just think that higher frequency and intensity of property-destroying fires in this case has more to do with different aggravating causes. 

I actually thing we should start to phase out income taxes and phase in carbon taxes in a way that keeps government revenue neutral. Let people keep more of their money, then use that money to vote for technologies that are more environmentally friendly with their wallets. And IMO I'd like to see large scale projets (similar to Manhattan Project, Apollo, The Interstate Highway system) to actively *reverse* a lot of the harm cased by ACG. For example doing things like reforestation, sinking CO2 by growing algae to be buried, Using pumped water/artificial snowmakers to increase ice reserves near the poles and on mountaintops etc. Though for that to work we'll (read: humanity) will have to re-empbrace nuclear power, which I don't see happening outside of China.

The only change I would make is on the first and second ones, if you are talking an 8"" diameter branch and you are bucking it in to rounds (by rounds here, I'm assuming that you are referring to lengths of the whole log and not fully prepared round blanks), I'd leave them more like at least 10-12"" long to allow you to later trim off any end checking and cracking that occurs. (Sometimes there's no stopping fruitwood even with the end sealer).

The third approach is the most fun since you get to turn the wood when it is very wet and the roughing out process goes very quickly. Check my post history- I just posted a long album on doing just that.

For this approach, a good rule of thumb is that you want to leave the thickness of the rough turned bowl at about 10% of its diameter. So for a 12"" salad bowl, you'd shoot for a wall thickness of about 1 1/4"". Then there will be enough left after it dries and ovalizes to still get a circle out of it. When you are done roughing it, coat completely in green wood end sealer and set aside to dry anywhere from 3 months to a year depending on your climate and the size of the bowl. If you want to get precise you can weigh it every day or week on a food scale and it will get lighter and lighter then when it stops changing weight, it's ready to go.

A fourth approach and, to me, this is even more fun, is to work green to final thickness in one go. If you can get it down to anywhere in the neighborhood of 1/4 - 3/8 inch thick quick enough, it generally won't crack and, especially in a natural-edge bowl or a calabash shape, the warping that occurs can really compliment the form!

Replacing junkers, old boilers, and shit windows will tangibly improve the lives of everyone, the poorest the most, as they are most likely to suffer with these things first hand - damp houses, respiratory problems, higher energy bills, fuel poverty. Better cycling infrastructure will improve national health. Wind power should have brought along a booming industry in this country, instead it was mismanaged and it's largely in Denmark.

I‘m not convinced by that argument. Acting against class interest to benefit yourself will remain a problem, even if you spread solidarity. Cause solidarity is just a social contract, and not a material difference in itself. Sadly things like climate change etc. are also prisoner’s dilemmas, so you can’t really resolve the original dilemma by factoring in costs that are themselves a dilemma. If you wanna look into it, you can extend the dilemma to an arbitrary amount of people and look at entire classes at once.

And this is just about the game, not actually material reality. In reality people aren‘t reasonable and act against their interest all the time. So convincing them of making the tradeoff you prefer doesn‘t need a logical foundation if you‘re morally willing to use propaganda. The game is designed as a counterexample to the logic of a ""greater good"".

Muahahhahah. ",,
1838,exfo57a,"I see you have the same canned, dismissive attitude towards ben shapiro that you do with everything else that doesn't fit your view.  If you watch the video you'll see how misplaced that characterization is.  I haven't provided sources because you are demanding sources for claims I am not making.  My statement you quoted this time is not a scientific statement that can be studied with any meaningful conclusion, so I'm not sure what you're hoping to see.  It's an analysis of the future effect of a political policy.  So I'll explain the reasoning.  

Oil is so prevalent because it is the cheapest, most reliable form of energy by a wide margin.  There are billions of people in the world that require cheap, reliable energy to live.  Simply forcing limitations on access to such a crucial resource results in millions of people around the world unable to heat their homes or get food or clean water to their community.  Then, since fossil fuels drive nearly every industry in the world, the world economy takes a massive hit, and organizations that fund relief efforts for those people will no longer have the money or means to do so.  There are already large amounts of people in the world heating homes with wood and dung because they can't even afford the cheapest form of energy, and we would be sending a huge percentage of the world's population into that level of poverty, if they survive at all.  I would rather see the sea level rise one foot over the next century (I believe that is the current IPCC prediction).  And that is only one example of a direct consequence.  Having such a cheap and reliable form of energy makes everything cheaper, and setting government imposed limitations directly increases the price of pretty much everything in the world.  Conversely, pursuing nuclear energy would lower the demand for oil, replace oil with clean energy wherever it is used, bringing down CO2 levels, and making everything cheaper.  

You keep mentioning a 95% figure and attribute it to several different, vague claims.  So let's be clear about what there is a consensus on.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you are referring to the [97% consensus](https://skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-cook-et-al-2013.html) since that is the most popular.  This consensus is attributed to pretty much any statement regarding climate change that is convenient to push a policy or prove a point.  If you read the actual study, which almost nobody that repeats it has done, you will see that it is not a consensus on anything you have claimed in our discussion.  That is not to say climate change isn't real, because virtually nobody thinks that the climate isn't changing.  The consensus is the result of a study which concluded that 97% of scientists believe that the main cause of a 0.8 degree increase over the past 150 years, is human activity.  It says nothing about preventative measures that have to happen, and asserts absolutely nothing about the future of the climate.  It simply claims that a 0.8 degree increase over 150 years is mainly due to humans.  And even then, the evidence is dubious since he includes papers that don't claim the degree to which humans are responsible (he calls explicit endorsement without quantification), and papers that don't even make the claim at all and the study just implies that it does (he calls ""implicit endorsement).  Several scientists included in that study have spoken out against it, claiming their papers were misrepresented in that study.  Still however, that study is propped up by democrats at the highest levels to make claims the study itself doesn't even claim to make, in order to justify leftist policy.  If you are referring to some other consensus, feel free to post a link.

Similarly, the link you posted has a very misleading standard for how they label someone a denier.  For example, the evidence for both Alaskans on there are statements from each that say that climate change is happening, but we don't know the degree to which humans are responsible.  This would, ironically, qualify for the 97% consensus standard, while qualifying for the ""denier"" label here.  And is by the way, a scientifically accurate statement, since there is no consensus on the degree to which humans are responsible.  So this actually proves my point about the false, anti-science stereotype being pushed by the left.",,

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

Humans collectively will address climate change on a level than means anything once and only once it becomes utterly impossible to ignore....in other words a course correction of the human population on a global scale.",,
1847,drxm2u8,"I ignored this for a reason.  It's a dumb observational question which if you frequent sites that discuss the issue every day it will seem from your POV that it's as important as ever.  It's not an issue that's being raised often on a national news level at this time.  

Beyond the obvious of it being based on perspective, how do I provide evidence of things not existing?  Do I link to news outlets to show it's not on their front page on this exact moment so you can retort with one that does because there's thousands of outlets and many have pet projects, some it will be climate change? 

So ya, I ignored your question because it's dumb and isn't a follow up to anything I said.  I mean just you pointing out the use of the word ""relative"" shows how stupid your question is.  Is the point you're going to make right now is climate change is as prominent in the news today as it was around the time of the Paris Accords?

1851,gi3uwv3,"Your comments appear to show you lean left,  democratic. Yet even saying one or the other is definitely not centrist,  which is obviously something you are not (centrist). The point of centrism is to not choose either. Of course, even the most perfect centrist is going to have biases that when pressured will force them to choose one choice or another that one could argue points dominately left or right, given each individual topic.  You mentioned about healthcare and climate in a previous comment as something you have noted that would tip centrists more towards a democratic viewpoint.  Even IF your personal experience has led you to believe that, you are assuming that believing in either of those immediately means that centrists are a step away from being democratic. Your flaw is that you are putting much to great a weight into thinking that those two topics are all that's needed to identify as democratic,  when in reality a centrist could for instance lean that way for those, yet every other idea (when pressured) could lean towards a right leaning stance. 

Either way you're missing the point of centrism.  Of course there will be biases, and I'm not going to argue whether those two you mentioned are more typical of a centrist or not, especially considering that I too believe that that universal healthcare should be attempted here in the US with greater conviction, while climate change is just something I believe we should all be conscious about yet I have no strong feelings towards. 

But ultimately, do I choose a sword to die on? No. Because centrists spend their thoughts on reviewing both cases, and view opinions and data among reasons for BOTH as to why it should and why it shouldn't be one way or the other. I said I lean more towards universal health care. That in no way means I believe it's the right way to do things, and I realize I might be completely wrong to think that way, which is why i am not passionate about it. 

Also, until you've dedicated a good portion of your time to studying such things, why even form an opinion? Do you have case articles, trialed examples, and extenuating circumstances to back up your claims? Do you have justification for the groups that will suffer due to your decisions,  if you were hypothetically given the power to make such changes? Are you able to justify sacrificing some for the ""greater good""? What about the ones who get the short end of the stick ? How many is worth sacrificing? 10 thousand? 1 million? How selfish are you to act like you have the say for even 1 person?
That's the problem with party systems, or any group that claims to have all the answers. There will always be others who bring up valid counterarguments. If that was not true, and the answer is as obvious, then we wouldn't have this tug of war on all major issues. Literally that right there shows you how wrong you are for choosing a side, and how pretentious you are for assuming you know best when there may be an equal number of people who claim opposite of your beliefs. 

Your trying to simplify things just doesnt work on a centrist, and you are honestly worse off for doing so yourself. So fuck off. I'm not trying to join your cult lol, I don't have a master and yours is obviously limiting you.",,

I hate this generalistic camp thinking but I guess it's human nature. If you're right at one thing you are right at all things and vice versa. Maybe I have some povs that I share with the worst dictators in history but so what?

I try to figure for myself if it is a real danger. I just don't know because there is so much evidence and so much political infection.

But from what I do know, I think I could start googling some things up and make an argument that the power the church had in 17th century Italy was akin to government control. Tithing was a thing, and could be considered a tax... And as I write this out, I'm realizing how perfect Galileo was for you to use.

What agencies mission involves studying nature on a planetary level?

&gt; We already do this x100. That is a major issue today, too many agencies not coordinating.

How is the idea of stopping/transferring research done by NASA addressing this issue or the issue of the science being ""too politicized""?

&gt; Beneifts: Helps other agencies in researching climate. Costs: Wasting NASA time when they should focus on space, their mission. Other agencies can tackle climate change research.

The issue cited is the research is to politicized, how is that being addressed?  Do NASA officials complain and say climate research is a burden?  I see people say this is good so NASA can find us ""Earth 2"".  Shouldn't the people who are suppose to find ""Earth 2"" have the knowledge to understand planetary level eco systems?

1913,cw078bq,"&gt;The rights of non-human species as collective entities outweigh those of individual human beings.

By what standard? Value judgement may be arbitrary, but the standard we judge them by is objective. The human life is, in most systems, the standard by which rights, values, and other intangibles are judged, for the simple reason that we are humans and have no reason to make value judgement by any other yardstick. 

&gt;The biosphere, the totality of life on this planet, is under an immediate threat, brought on by the human species.

&gt;If we do not act very rapidly, it will be too late to save most non-human lifeforms

I am not a climatologist, biologist, or other similar specialist. However, I believe that the majority of specialists in those fields would agree that while climate change is real and anthropocentric, these claims of impending doom are wildly overblown. My belief is compounded by your lack of peer-reviewed scientific sources for this claim (studies on what will happen to specific parts of the biosphere are not generalizable to the entire biosphere). Furthermore, ""very rapidly"" is a meaningless phrase that is used by scare-mongers with no serious evidence. Can you provide a time-frame with significant testing and modelling that supports your conclusions, and demonstrates that the rate of technological increase is not rapid enough to fit within your scale? Or did you just form a genocidal, terrorist political philosophy based on meaningless phrases and doomsaying millenalism?

&gt;No solution that does not result in a rapid decrease in the human population has a reasonable chance of addressing our problem.

Your reasoning for this claim seems to rely on your statement that ""if there was a techno fix out there, don't you think we would have discovered it by now?"" Which is a logical fallacy. The same claim could have been used in the neolithic age to argue that since no one had discovered crop rotation, agricultural civilization was clearly impossible. Without further evidence or reasoning, there is no reason to accept this assertion. 

&gt;Specifically, clandestine groups need to focus on developing novel pathogens capable of rapidly eradicating at least 90% of the human population.

1920,gzle606,"I agree on his general point, although I still think the weather is a somewhat misleading analogy as our relationship with the weather is very one sided - there is no back and forth there (at an immediate level - things like climate change excluded of course).

Regarding personal responsibility - I think you can still put a huge focus on individualism, if you choose to do so, and not be a hypocrite. For example, if a society chooses to apply punishments  - it can apply them collectively (which has certainly been a 'thing' in many times and places) to the family / town / community surrounding a wrongdoer, or it can apply them only to the individual/s who specifically perpetrated a criminal act. The same with rewards - you can issue a patent, and the monetary rewards that go with it, to individual people, or you can have a more collectivist model surrounding intellectual property, for example. Another example - people can be enculturated to feel that either lower or higher levels of group support, when completing a task, are socially appropriate - the 'self starter' model vs. the 'synergy' model. When discussing rewards, punishments, and support, you can be absolutely draconian or a total flower child but in either case still draw the boundaries of where the 'proximate cause' of an act is around individual people or around another entity - again, perhaps a family, tribe, city, town, nation, etc. For practical purposes, everyone ends up drawing a rather arbitrary boundary somewhere or other. 

In summary - I think the discussion of individualism in the West is an interesting one, but not necessarily dependent on the idea of free will. Just like I think the question of how mild or harsh ""punishments as deterrents"" should be is an important one, but not necessarily dependent on the idea of free will either.",,

Hillary voted for the war in Iraq, but she likes to overlook this and whenever it comes up, she always dodges it by pinning the blame on the Bush administration. I can understand that Bush did say there could have been nuclear weapons there, but the invasion itself literally did not need to happen- there was no concrete evidence of WMDs, but even so there were already UN inspectors searching for nuclear and chemical weapons in Iraq, and they were doing a pretty good job of forcing Iraqi cooperation up until Bush forced them out of country.

Moving onwards. Most people do eat grains, legumes, and vegetables as their main sources of nutrition. I never denied that. But they also consume meat, fish, insects, and fungi to supplement their diets. To go fully vegan, is to eschew important nutrient sources that you otherwise cannot acquire outside of consuming supplements/vitamins. And quite frankly, a lot of people just like meat for the taste, texture. No stopping those people, and I’m one of them.

I think that most vegans oppose the consumption of meat and dairy on an ethical basis, because of how poorly the treatment of livestock and domesticated animals bred for food are treated. 

That’s fine and dandy, but veganism is an individual choice. With your argument, you aren’t convincing the vast majority of the population of rich(er) people to stop consuming meat/dairy.

Can you provide a source for this?  I don't think it's a matter of warmer climates lacking meat, it's a matter of frigid climates lacking plant matter and sugar.  [Roughly 10% of Inuit people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose_intolerance) are sucrose intolerant, meaning they are completely unable to digest it (which is saying a lot for such a common substance, and the fact that they all descend from equatorial people in the first place)

Plains Americans for example subsisted off of bison, to the extent that white settlers brought the animal to extinction in order to kill the Natives off.  That is definitely not a cold climate, it is solidly temperate or something similar.

I think it has more to do with the fact that cold climates favor small populations, and small populations mean less competition for resources, so darker skin is allowed to flourish due to D-rich animal diets.  At least until you get invaded by agricultural/pastoral peoples who change the lifestyle to a lacto-vegetarian one, which favors light skin (like what happened in Europe over the last 10k years).  Dark skin is essentially a biological ""luxury"", similar to a large body or other features that indicate a wealth of resources--at least it acts that way in the shadier climates.

Lastly, there is also the issue of fish vs. meat--fish have higher vitamin D levels than meat, which of course have higher levels than lactovegeterian foods.  So marine-based peoples are usually going to be darker than any other groups, when holding latitude constant.  You can sort of see this in action in paleolithic Europe--the further west you went, the darker the Europeans were, and of course the west has far more marine resources and a longer coastline.",,

1948,e8qju8f,".... my god, did you really need all caps for this? It makes you sound like you’re investing way too much emotionally in defending Elon Musk. Do you need to get so worked up in defending him? 

I’m only going to respond to certain parts of this, for the simple reason that there’s so much to cover.

&gt;There’s no such thing as bad PR

This is patently false, and is a lie repeated by idiots. There is such a thing as bad PR, and it’s calling a hero a pedophile because he didn’t like your iPod submarine, ranting about fake news on twitter, and then openly lying to investors before being fined $20 million dollars for lying. I don’t see how any of that is good PR for Elon. 

&gt;He’s a scientist

No he isn’t.

&gt;He will go down in history for sparking the electric car revolution

1: assuming there will be an electric car revolution, instead of say a public transport revolution, or a hydrogen fuel cell revolution, or a actual revolution

It’s a bit soon to say if there is a revolution, and definitely too soon to credit any one person for starting it. I could just as easily assign it to the people that actually founded Tesla, or to researchers who have found better batteries. 

&gt;the 35k model 3 is coming

Proof? 

&gt;he has been doing this only 15 years

Ford has been doing it for 100 years. And how is that an excuse for him throwing the entire textbook on how to make cars out the window? And surely he’d have learnt how to properly build cars in say, 5 years, not 15? 

&gt;4000 cars a week going 24/7 is 23 cars an hour. How do they do that? It’s a modern marvel

Ford made 10000 Model T’s *every day* in *1925*. It’s not modern, and it’s not a marvel, it’s mass production. 

(Yes I know a model t is easier to make, but manufacturing tech has advanced massively since then. You’d think that Tesla could manage 10k a week if ford could do 70k a week with 1920s technology). 

&gt;I know people who work at Tesla and SpaceX, they love it. If you don’t like it just quit

Fuck me, not the “if it’s so bad why don’t you just leave” argument. You know people work shitty jobs they hate because they have to? Or do all McDonald’s workers choose to work there? The guy who shovels shit onto a landfill, does he stay there because he loves his job or because he needs money? 

Also, that’s anecdotal evidence. I don’t know for 100% certain that you have friends that work there, but even if you do and they love it, that doesn’t invalidate the shit Reveal found. 

&gt;Why is he doing this (in response to my point about him not actually working his arse off

Gee, could it possibly be that he wants even more money? Do you think people just make money and then are suddenly perfectly content with what they have? No, they want more. 

&gt;you’re making that up

Lol no https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856415001354

&gt;(I’ve slightly condensed this point) Elon has multiple companies, therefore he needs a private jet to manage them

Have you ever heard of this thing called email? Or a telephone? Or, perhaps he could drive his Tesla if he really needs to be there? I’m sure he doesn’t need to be at SpaceX every day right? Or at SolarCity, unless he handles all 3 annual orders of solar city shit personally? He probably does need to be at Tesla tbf though. Doesn’t require him to fly everywhere. 

&gt;people like to drive

Indeed, but as has been previously established, the mindset of keeping cars enables the extremely dangerous belief that tackling climate change requires no action on our part. I’m sure that if I said “we need to stop dropping nukes to prevent climate change”, no one would say “but people like dropping nukes”. That’s the kind of stupidity this argument is.

&gt;Buses are uncomfortable, dirty and dangerous *and will always be like that* 

That’s a straight up lie and you know it. Not sure what the bus services are like where you live, but here in England they’re clean, safe, well run, and comfortable. The idea that bus services are NEVER going to improve is such straight up BS I can’t believe someone would say that. 

&gt;Rich people drive Tesla’s

Rich people can be exceedingly stupid. The suggestion that they drive them, therefore smart people like Tesla is a non sequitur that assumes rich people are inherently smart and that poor people are inherently dumb. That is downright offensive and certainly patronising. Also, and here’s a thought, *maybe rich people are buying tesla’s because they’re expensive and they are therefore seen as a status symbol*. 

&gt;no but most of the negativity is misguided

Ahah! So now you’ve admitted there are criticisms of musk that are legitimate! Care to elaborate on them? 

Also, you didn’t address that I had called you out on your blatant strawman, and instead just said some bs about most opposition to musk being wrong, without elaborating on why they’re wrong. 

&gt;I’ve known people with PHDs that can’t tie their shoes

What does this have to do with you alledging that all smart people like musk? Or are you saying you personally know every single person with a PHD who doesn’t like musk, and that they all can’t tie their shoe laces? 

Just saying “some people with PHDs are dumb” doesn’t do anything to counter the point of “many smart people have called out musk”. 

&gt;he’s changing the world bubba

Please don’t call me bubba. And how exactly is he changing the world? In a quantifiable, provable way.

&gt;he’s just as weird as Edison and Hughes and willy wonka

Great. I don’t get what him being weird has to do with him being a genius or not. Unless you’re saying “he’s weird, some geniuses were weird, therefore genius”. Well I’m sorry, but there are also weird people that aren’t geniuses. Lee Langer sits on a bench and sniffs glue sticks all day, doesn’t make him the next Einstein. ",,

1952,czj36uw,"&gt;I start with the premise that coercive laws have to be morally justified. If this isn't a moral issue, then it cannot be used to justify any coercive laws, such as environmental standards for instance.

What I would say is that this is an issue of long-term human welfare.  If we allow climate change to happen to a really serious degree (say, greater then 2.5 degrees C of warming this century) then it is going to negatively impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people, maybe billions of people.   

And yes, of course there is a moral issue there when we're talking about human welfare.   But it's not like ""fossil fuels are evil, burning them is wrong"".   A better way to think of it is ""we are going to have to leave about half of the fossil fuel reserves we know of underground and unburnt in order to avoid the really catastrophic effects of climate change. How can we get there from here? How can we transition our energy system over to a point where we cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 and eliminate them by about 2050, and do it without destroying our economy or reverting ourselves back to a pre-industrial era level of standard of living?""

(Because, of course, having a total collapse of our current technological and economic system would also be an issue of human welfare that would impact the lives of billions of people, so we also want to avoid that.)

&gt; I also like how you're in favor of creating the most long-lived externalities there are, i.e. nuclear waste.

Nuclear waste is a managable problem, if handled correctly.   Even if you didn't care about climate change at all, nuclear power plants are still much less of an environmental issues in other ways then coal plants (from coal mining and the way that destroys rivers, to the air pollution the coal plant creates, to the mercury and lead that ends up in the oceans, and so on and so fourth).   

Maybe at some point we can phase out nuclear plants too and go to a totally renewable system, but that's a much lower priority then phasing out fossil fuels.

&gt;So why get rid of burning coal but not of [insert random other activity that causes greenhouse gas emissions]? What about the people who make profits with burning coal? What about the people who just love burning coal? 

Coal is the biggest problem; like I said, it's pretty much our dirtiest energy source. 

If we're going to leave half of the fossil fuels we know about underground, which we will need to do, then it makes sense to first avoid mining coal, and doing things like mining tar sands.   Basically stop the dirtiest and most inefficient sources of fossil fuel energy first, and then work back from there.    

Eventually (by, say, 2050 or so) we need to get to a place where ALL our electricity is either nuclear or renewable, where our cars and trains are electric or something similar, and basically where we no longer burn fossil fuels.  But we're going to have to get there in stages, it's going to be a huge job.",,

1956,d5a58x7,"Here's his [Issues page](https://johnsonweld.com/issues/).

The one that stands out is Environment:

&gt; The environment is a precious gift and needs to be protected. Gov. Johnson believes strongly that the first responsibility of government is to protect citizens from those who would do them harm, whether it be a foreign aggressor, a criminal — or a bad actor who harms the environment upon which we all depend.

&gt; Consistent with that responsibility, **Gary Johnson believes it is the proper role of government to enforce reasonable environmental protections. He did so as Governor, and would do so as President.**

&gt; However, Gov. Johnson also believes that it is NOT the proper role of government to engage in social and economic engineering for the purpose of manipulating the energy marketplace or creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market. Such efforts have failed in the past, and are doomed to continue to fail. Preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing. Deciding in Washington, DC, that one source of energy should be subsidized and others penalized is a different matter.

&gt; In a healthy economy that allows the market to function unimpeded, consumers, innovators and personal choices will ultimately bring about the environmental restoration and protection society desires. Conversely, destroying prosperity and innovation through government intervention will only harm the environment.

&gt; When it comes to global climate change, Gov. Johnson believes too many politicians are having the wrong debate. Is the climate changing? Probably so. Is man contributing to that change? Probably so. The important question, however, is whether the government’s efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the marketplace in order to impact that change are cost-effective — or effective at all. Given the realities of global energy and resource use, there is little evidence that the burden being placed on Americans is making a difference that justifies the cost.

Or it could be that everything that Trump does seems to agree with Russia. They rely on fossil fuel to feed their economy. Global warming, caused by the very thing they sell, is a problem. So, Trump and the Russians dismiss climate change. War and conflict raise oil prices, and so Russia and Trump both seek to increase conflict around the world. Oligarchs, made obscenely wealthy by a corrupt political system in Russia, want no part of a unified world where carbon tax and sensible long term thinking guide policy.

I'm going to place a bigger emphasis on investing in real estate than a lot of people in the FIRE community seem to do.

I'm hoping that land and houses in cities that haven't been affected by climate change will become more valuable as some places become less habitable. But I do worry that the economy will start to fall apart as climate change worsens and people just won't have the income to afford housing and rent prices which will cause the value of everything to go down because of lack of demand. I feel like we're already seeing people opt out by getting tiny homes and living in vans. 

I'm starting a homestead with my partner and investing in practical tools like a sawmill and land with extra trees for firewood so we can decrease our reliance on food, utilities, etc. Hopefully we can get our costs as low as possible and not really need a whole lot of income.

I think a Massachusetts Republican could absolutely win a general election in this political climate...I just think a Massachusetts Republican can't run on a Massachusetts Republican platform and still win the Republican nomination. 

It's dammed if you do, dammed if you don't for the Republicans. The Democrats do a better job at nominating Centrist candidates (some would say that's a bad thing, but that's for a different discussion) and not having a climate that forces the Democratic field to cannibalize each other and change views during the primary season to stay afloat. 

On the other hand (and as an ancillary note), the Republicans are much better at filling legislative seats across the country, at least in the last decade or three. ",,

He also has a full platform of tending to indigenous people as well!

He wants to get rid of all taxes related to climate change and actually put policies like cleaning our oceans and lands. PPC as a party believe climate change is legitimate, but does not believe the scare that is being perpetuated amongst the left and the Conservatives.

There is no possibility of discourse with them. You'll never change their minds. They enter into the debate with the intention of getting triggered before you even open your mouth. 

Granted, it's the same with a lot of people on the right, too, but that illustrates my point -ideologies are dangerous. Doesn't matter how far left or right they are. When people buy into some group label, it creates imbeciles that cannot think for themselves and abandon critical thought in favor of hivemind groupthink. 

Feminism is just one of the many ideologies that is spreading toxicity into our society. It has roots in marxism, so that's not surprising.

Yes, climate change does exist, it's the alarmists and extremists that are turning the molehill into a mountain and it's all in the name of making money, usually from those gullible enough to believe the propaganda.

&gt; Today’s planetary ecological crisis is due first and foremost to the increasing scale of the capitalist world economy. The greater the scale of the economy the more it rivals the fundamental biogeochemical cycles of the planet. All of this is connected to the nature and logic of capitalism, understood as a system directed at the accumulation of capital. Capitalism is a grow-or-die system. If accumulation declines, the result is economic crisis. The answer of the system is to boost accumulation. This, however, intensifies global environmental crises as the already visible impact of the economy on the Earth System increases

I'm not following your reasoning. Musk isn't suggesting that we all pack up and move to Mars. The idea of having colonies on other planets is that *in case* humanity (or life in general) on Earth goes extinct, we have a backup. The fact that not everyone will be saved is besides the point. Not everybody around the world can afford whatever medicine they need; that doesn't mean we should stop investing in pharmaceutical R&amp;D.

&gt; Also, humans can barely care for earth and musk wants to colonize another planet? Doesn’t make sense.

I'm still not following. Of course we should take care of our planet. I think everyone on /r/vegan will agree. I'm unsure what that has to do with the colonization of Mars. One of the reasons we *should* colonize other planets is because we're failing at protecting this one, so we should have backups as an insurance policy. If your objection to colonizing Mars is that we will also fuck up the Martian environment, than I have two points in regards to that:

1. Nobody is talking about terraforming Mars any time in the near future. Our technology and knowledge isn't remotely advanced enough to attempt doing that. We're only talking about building small, isolated colonies.
2. Even *if* we were terraforming Mars, there's no ethical issue with that (imo). The reason why fucking up Earth's environment is so unethical is because there are billions of humans and trillions upon trillions of animals suffering due to climate change, deforestation, overfishing, etc. Changing the Martian climate to be more habitable isn't negatively impacting a single sentient creature. A lump of rock is not a moral patient on its own, no matter if it's a pebble or the size of a planet.",,

Implying any of this attributes to renewables. There still hasn't been replaced a single conventional plant by renewables, there are plenty of very different plans on how to achieve a grid based on renewables of which none is proven to be working and cheap is only true for LCOE, which is a metric that does not work for a renewable grid.

That cost and time argument is just anti nuclear propaganda that ignores climate change as a real threat. 

Either way we are doing things that are expensive and will have massive changes to our systems - but neither of them is more expensive or troublesome than climate change.
