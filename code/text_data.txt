nice try but false equivalency is still false one party literally has anti science climate change denial as a core mainstream belief the other does
i slightly torn on this the idea of nations trying to hash out the problem is a step in the right direction but being real this deal will do fuck all to help the climate in the long run i feel it gives politicians the ability to rebut questions about in action on climate change along the lines of well we did the paris accord we currently see politicians acknowledging it is enough but normally there is no follow up proposal about what would make it enough killing the deal may bring everyone back to the table and could net a stronger deal or it could just die and the hold gets even deeper
article contents as always south australian premier peter malinauskas has pulled a major surprise picking an independent mp to join his new cabinet the premier on thursday named geoff brock as his local government regional and veterans affairs minister mr brock won the mid north seat of stuart in saturday election after successfully switching from his electorate of frome to take on former deputy premier dan van holst pellekaan the change was prompted by boundary changes which moved many of his supporters from frome into stuart mr brock had previously served as a minister in the labor administration of former premier jay weatherill after he provided support in for mr weatherill to form a minority government but with labor likely to hold a clear majority in the next parliament the new government did not need his support this time less surprising on thursday was the appointment of nick champion as trade and investment minister mr champion easily won the northern suburbs seat of taylor after making the switch from federal parliament where he had served for almost years other members of the labor minister were largely predictable with most taking on the same roles they held on the opposition front bench chris picton has been named health minister stephen mullighan treasurer tom koutantonis infrastructure and transport minister and blair boyer education minister deputy premier susan close increased her workload with the portfolios of industry and science space and defence industries climate environment and water four of the new ministers kyam maher nat cook katrine hildyard and andrea michaels will need to formally take their oaths at a later date after taking part in the government house ceremony by video link while in isolation labor cabinet reveal came as counting neared a close after saturday poll with the new government almost certain to hold seats in the seat house of assembly the liberals will probably hold with four or possibly five going to independents former premier steven marshall in dunstan is still locked in a tight contest with labor cressida in the eastern suburbs seat of dunstan after trailing earlier this week mr marshall has pulled ahead but will need the remaining pre poll and postal votes to continue favouring him to get across the line australian associated press by tim dornin updated march first published
what is the current outlook for ocean acidification at current rates of global climate change what sectors of the blue economy could ocean acidification compromise
they just say some innane bullshit of sure it changing but it not man made climate change
you engagingly in the legal equivalent of climate change denialism you ignoring expert r anything because you do like what the experts have to say
how do you not believe in climate change that s like common sense
i believe in climate change not that we will all die from a scorched planet in a decade or even a century quite glad this is considered unpopular
the bottom line is people get almost all of the information they consume from the internet and television if both of those things are centrally controlled it will be very difficult to convince anyone to care about something different than what those in control want you to care about good luck convincing enough people to make a difference about climate change if every piece of information people are being fed is telling them it not real i not here to tell you not to care about climate change it important i just so fucking tired of net neutrality getting swept under the rug in public discourse without truly free speech everything else in our society will erode at the whims of those who control the flow of information
i guess it makes sense considering that the ruling classes do want to deal with climate change so no point saving for retirement if we all gon na die in years intriguing of the tories to go for the depressed environmental voting bloc
nothing for any statement you can find someone who will honestly disagree does matter how moronic disagreeing is anti vaccers climate change denyers flat earthers or something even more stupid than that you name it and someone somewhere will actually believe it
your statement rests on the assumption that we know our home will be completely destroyed by climate change when it will be destroyed and that there is only one possible way to prevent this destruction if all that were true i would agree with you that the discussion is over since i think there are multiple possible solutions and since i am not certain we know when let alone if climate change will destroy humanity given its current trajectory i will continue to push for more investigation before accepting a standpoint as extreme as all mitigation costs are irrelevant if you truly believed mitigation costs are irrelevant then you have considered all the horribly violent and cheap means available for reducing humanities footprint
bernie donated all to charity so how much was donated to charity please share a link to the tax returns if there is nothing to hide why not release the videos and transcripts i would love to hear what she has to say and could learn a lot from it like you described talking about republicans who deny climate change when you are in democratic primary sounds like dodging i initially got interested in sanders because of his speeches especially his and half hour speech against the tax cuts for the rich during obama first term if i can listen to those valuable speeches i surely could be swayed by them and could support her
because maybe we can delay a fascist united states for another generation or two that really all i can hope for dems are less bad than repubs but it still holding off another great terror for a little bit and if we can somehow get electoral reform in there maybe we can make repubs obsolete and split the dems into conservative and progressive parties maybe if we can do that things could get better and we could get back to some sort of political normalcy and slowly whittle down the influence of religious zealotry in our representation but if we do come together as a planet on climate change there will be plenty of other things to worry about anyway so we are pretty much fucked
puma has overtaken climate change as the threat to the world
could you perhaps give me an example of a concrete policy that would involve this structural change just so i have a clearer idea of what you mean by this structural changes and baseline political values are just one easily summarised thing but the capitalism v socialism dichotomy or the existence of states woupd be the two largest ones there also a lot of smaller ones around how say jobs work or public bodies is the police directly publicly controlled or is it a professional body of the state okay so i want to come back to a point i made in my original post which is that government spending in most countries takes place within a relatively narrow range another way to put this point is that radical libertarianism and radical socialism have both been effectively eliminated as viable policy programmes in established democracies this feels very end of history to me the idea that liberal democracy is some kind of political apotheosis is na√Øve at best especially when we are facing one of the largest crises ever as a consequence of our economic structures climate change it also very much an argument for what ought to be from what is which is bad reasoning just because now is the heydey for a specific idea does by any means make their policies good or optimal it was once the heydey of monarchies and fedualism and that was clearly awful restrictive and oppressive monarchies did a huge amount of long term economically inefficient things or even short term all to maintain the vested interests of those already with power those with vested interests inherently limit what is politically achievable and what is politically conceivable we now live in a world with globalised capital and the free movement of capital which is one of the core vested powers and as such to not feel their ire and to not have them use their political power against you losing your leadership role you can not fight their interests easily
that super interesting wonder if it a result of climate change
step accept that the nmbs sncb will be operating at a loss for a significant amount of time step do treat public transport as a product or a company but as a public service that can help us tackle problems of mobility and climate change step find a way to deal with the news single view view infrabel consults on brussels that is brussels central station step expand connections and services to make public transport a viable alternative for everyday travel there no way to handle this without large investments
i think in the latter part of the century this could actually happen because of climate change canada would be less affected than many parts of the us americans would cross the border could be the the start of a canada us merger and there would be much canada could do assuming we still live under a neoliberal hellscape i sure the cad would care too much
i definitely like to see a version of reality where the florida vote rigging and hanging chad bullshit got intercepted at the pass with president al gore having lead the world on a proper response to climate change twenty fucking years ago that be great
the dnc have put fausi on ice you hardly hear a peep from him anymore they try to just sweep it all under the rug and move on with climate change as the next big scare tactic
also our government whose representatives all deeply furrow their brows at the mention of climate change all of them do this now unless deeply furrow their brows is some way to conflate acknowledging an existential threat with denying it as conspiracy theory whenever i see someone try to both sides an issue i immediately suspect their motives and understanding
paying more into nato being another case of many where trump falsely tries to take credit for something he had no part in the beef trade deal a case where he taking credit for something that has happened and he has increased military presence abroad and i do even want to comment on his being a climate change denier
yess i saw and i was crying the first half he also gives new perspective than our own selfish perspective that we used to have i used to think the effects of climate change on humans only i did even once thought about the flora and fauna this documentary brings in perspective and i was happy that it did end on a positive note and about how we can start making changes i just hope people are motivated to do it rather than blaming others or the government it time we take actions every kid or most kids like me wants to be a super hero and save the world from evil supervillains like they show in movies but the sad reality is that the true supervillains are us the human beings so i guess it on every single one of us to save this planet and be the superhero we always wanted to be
the report does say that you need to become vegan it says that all of us should choose plant based meals more often which is healthier cheaper and better for the planet again veganism has exploded in popularity from jus to almost million in the usa in years many many people cite concerns about climate change for this switch we not losing support for climate action we gaining it you just do like the direction because you do want your preferences questioned we all need to pay the true costs of the things we buy whether it be meat or clothing subsidizing cheap food that is killing us is helping any of us
hold on you just arbitrarily said that if those vital machines and things contribute then it a low priority but if they contribute then it a much higher priority at what point does it become a high priority just because we ca assign a number to what percentage these specific activities contribute to global warming and climate change does automatically mean it a small amount what the drawback to using cleaner energy and finding more efficient ways to produce energy what the incentive to keep burning through nonrenewable resources instead of harnessing the near infinite supply of renewable energies you also saying that like transportation medical machines computers etc are capable of running off of electricity that cleaner produces less emission
i ca see civilisation making it past with climate change bearing down on us so that generations max if climate change worsens the mass extinction we have started and it will then it possible there will be no humans within the next millenium so generations max i would say though i would not be surprised if it was much less
depends look at the black death or a massive reduction of population means their labour is now worth significantly more people getting paid a fair wage would probably put to rest a lot of the populism gripping the world and raise a new a middle class look at tony time machine people built that which means tony would spent money currently wrapped up in savings gathering interest this economic activity from him and other billionaires would make both them and the poor richer probably i not an economist there was even that line from cap about whales reemerging so ecological disaster was averted and climate change halted probably i not an ecologist i do to make this an r thanoswasright post and it not like snapping away wildlife and plants was a good idea but if the snap hits everyone equally rich countries will focus on renewal for which they will happily accept cheap immigrant labour i get that they ca show everything but i would be interested to see more of the post snap world seems like not much changed people are sad people are missing some places need cleaning up but magicking in everyone that disappeared would bring its own set of problems
oh yeah farmers have an absolutely incredible connection to their land in general the land plays a much more important role in the lives of regional australians than anyone else however while farmers will care for their own land with tangible benefits for maintaining it well and visible negatives for not caring for it many do not have much care for the more intangible concept of global climate change there are more immediate impacts that farmers care about like the drought pressures from mining and gas corporations and there simply not enough room for them to care about the long term intangible affects of greenhouse gas emissions and the paris climate accord and as i said in my comment it disingenuous to take the outlying farmers who do actually believe strongly in climate change and want to see things done about it and then frame them as the standard model for australian farmers
you realize that the only way any politician could actually meaningfully affect climate change would be to instigate military conflict with and subsequently subjugate china india and most of the middle east right even if we outlawed fossil fuels in america tomorrow we still fucked unless you willing to colonize china and china has nukes so that be kinda tough to pull off
washington nearly half of global money managers are making investment decisions without factoring in risks or opportunities associated with climate change according to a survey released on wednesday by a coalition of environmentalists and investors a related report recommended that money managers and institutional investors do climate risk assessments on all investments and encourage the securities and exchange commission to encourage full disclosure of climate risks
its not even about climate change
grain farmer here as the worlds population continues to grow studies continue to find that there is not enough tillable farm land to produce enough produce to keep up with the demands of a ever increasing population the worlds food shortages is already at critical levels in most areas of the world moving to a strictly vegetarian diet is not sustainable or going to solve world hunger or climate change what will is moving to a healthy mixed diet using gmo science to provide healthier and more productive crop yields and stop food waste gluttony in western world countries
technically classical liberal but i give my two cents because i lumped in with the right anyhow read it but also yes it is happening but not as bad as shifty folks are trying to portray the west ca do much about it without severely sacrificing our industry economy which is already tenuous enough where i say climate change note this does include things like conservation not dumping waste into rivers which i am in full favor of needs to be on the backburner i believe it is happening but not to the drastic effect that many people attempt to portray it as i am hesitant to trust the american left wing who try to make it seem apocalyptic and i hope you can see that leaders on the left have been mighty shifty scummy recently also the majority of the studies into the phenomenon are funded or done at universities which are a notorious breeding ground for left wing ideology any change we as western countries make to fix it would have negligible effect on the total contribution as seen by the paris climate agreement predicted results the majority of damage to the climate is currently coming from china and india the two most densely populated places on earth the economies in those areas are improving and people are starting to purchase more old freon air conditioners cars etc environmental and safety regulations over there are laughable which is why you see more and more companies move all their factories there there a reason trump considers china a rival the paris agreement would have placed heavy restriction on us industry while not tackling the worst offenders if there was some multinational accord that was fair and did just give china and india a slap on the wrist i might support it now none of this applies to conservation which i believe should be the world primary focus now teddy roosevelt was my favorite president because he cared about every aspect of this country including its natural beauty maintaining our natural resources is crucial to the safety and happiness of not only our environment but humanity as a whole i am firmly for any ways to lower trash impact reduce landfills save our waterways plant more trees etc hell i even try to grow some vegetables and herbs so that i am not giving money to those that would destroy forests to expand farms the economy in america is great but it could crash at any moment i want to focus on getting us into a better state before we can focus on anything else trump has done well so far and i trust that in years once we have a more stable and secure country maybe we can start taking a look at climate i do have a question or a few for you op what is your proposed solution what do you think would save the world here and how long would it take what do you imagine the impact of that decision would be these are serious questions i not trying to entrap you i want to know your point of view
a refutal by frank mitloehner this same mitloehner and what about the m in research funding that mitloehner has received since as is right and proper mitloehner freely publishes all the details on his website as a pdf document here we learn that over this period he has received from the national pork board as well as sizeable grants from the us department of agriculture and something called the agriculture air research council aarc which according to the pork checkoff website is an independent non profit organisation formed to oversee and manage the air emissions research the aarc board of directors has two representatives from each participating livestock sector including one member from the national pork board and one from the national pork producers council
are we dying people have been predicting the end of the world due to climate change since the and they have been wrong every time how many god damn times are we gon na have to hear climate change will destroy the planet in years if we do nt act now its all bullshit where do they get this years computer models fucking computer models can barely predict the weather and we freak out and act like the sky is falling and act like its a fact when these predictions have historically been wrong every time basically if we pull all the bullshit that the radical environmentalist fanatics want billions would starve to death this year you seem to be afraid of people dying many years into the future but that wo nt happen we are going to be using fossil fuels in the future its not going to be a issue
this is why i overlooked trump stance on climate change washington is going to get a fucking single thing done for the good of the average human being if they are too busy trying to make themselves rich
now read ryan one about whales then grimes bit about the polar bears again oscillate between them here is my theory this is the same quote tumbled out of different mouths ok let actually do this lol here are the two quotes ryan this new york thing is being blown out of proportion what about whales they are ignoring animals that are more important animals need saving and that more important grimes i want to make climate change fun people do care about it because we being guilted i see the polar bear and want to kill myself no one wants to look at it you know i want to make a reason to look at it i want to make it beautiful ryan quote can be reduced like this was not that bad this other thing dying whales is much worse than therefore people should stop worrying about and worry about whales grimes quote can be reduced like this climate change is important people do like to think about things that make them feel bad let increase the visibility of climate change by making the topic fun and beautiful grimes never says climate change is bad she also is arguing that something else is worse than it also ryan is arguing about two things and deciding one is worse than the other while grimes is just talking about one thing and thinking about how best to brand it for success finally was a punctuated trauma while climate change is a slow process with delayed effects so the emotional contexts in which the quotes were uttered are not remotely equivalent in conclusion the quotes are the same at all and it actually really hard to directly compare them since they so different in structure and intent this either means the author is so bad at thinking that they believe this is a valid comparison or they do care at all about misdirecting their readers in order to smear a celebrity for clicks either way it makes for a weird and dumb article not a good look for the guardian imo
ok dude just expect more year of trump if you elect a hilary this is irrelevant to your reasoning for bernie or bust but okay i pretty agnostic about the electability of any candidate every one of them polls better than trump but sanders is definitely a risky choice his election will probably require historically high turnout among demographics that are less reliable we do need more progressive votes in california or the ne we need suburban voters in swing states there was plenty of evidence in that more moderate candidates can achieve this there was no evidence that more progressive ones could i not saying president sanders could happen but his path to an win seems narrower just look at his actions wisdom you should accept yourself please tell me what his actions have been with regard to gun reform and climate change please tell me what his position historically has been on abortion net neutrality and gay marriage please tell me what platform he is currently running on relating to health care and the trump tax cuts now tell me where republicans and conservatives stand and have stood on those matters please stop with this low information crap
or has the bill passed already the house can pass it any time it chooses it more important that both pieces are passed as originally intended letting republicans win will ensure defeat in the midterms it ridiculous to think in our current climate it will suddenly change that one of the most short sighted comments i seen on reddit in some time do you follow the science of climate change at all it an existential crisis for humanity and we have precious little time to act
and everyone is worried about ghg with that bad boy going up we never recovering from climate change
let give the zoomers a break they been raised by a generation of people who have repeatedly made it very clear that they also do care about any important issues that do impact them climate change affordable housing etc like you i not happy with how some young people are treating this pandemic but i not sure how we do see that we reaping what we sown here
i thought that climate change is crap was already doing just that
i still wonder why they communicate the dangers of climate change in global temp increases and not specific heat and that energy being added to the weather systems
and there no money at all in denying climate change and keeping the status quo of oil companies ripping the planet apart
ugh so true let just ignore pollution and climate change and make no changes to the way we live and produce energy that surely help
i feel much less worried about climate change since biden won and put america back in the agreement while being british but i know we got a long way to go seeing how dumb so many people responded to covid no matter what they told i m not surprised they like this with climate
i am a bit of hypocrite in this case i love all the technology and the comfort it has brought but at the same time think we should have advanced so much that is causing climate change and have endangered all other animals
is that even going to mean accomplish anything we a tiny drop in the pond of climate change
ah yes because supporting bernie and supporting progressive values are necessarily synonymous nobody could possibly agree with him on his limited range of issues while still finding him inadequate as a potential chief executive since that a logical impossibility the party failure to embrace him must be attributable to something dark well the rejection of teh issues by both clinton and the people who support her and vote for her certainly supports the idea that the democratic party is not progressive at least on those specific issues and compare sanders true statement that climate change is teh ost important foreign policy issue we face with clinton elaborate staements about details of dealing with various countries and only minor mentions of climate change embedded in the larger discussion there is no loarger discussion if the average case put forth by climate scientists is true the cia notes that climate change will drive mass migrations of of millions of people that will lead to local wars on a scale that has never been seen before and if the worst case scenariors are true we lose all coastal areas in every country in the world and the mass migrations will be on the order of multiple billions of people discussing details while pushing the elephant in the room to the side is not being progressive or realistic in any sense of the word and yet that is how clinton presents her foreign policy and that is what people who vote for clinton are in favor of incremental solutions to the ultimate this side of a collision with an asteroid environmental catastrophe not progressive not even sane and she only matches up well compared to climate change deniers but we ca afford someone who is only better when comparing them to self destructive loons
i try to help people whenever i can it does need to be big help maybe just realistic support or encouragement helping people builds a more helpful world i also focusing on improving myself where possible that often makes it easier for me to help people i also trying to be aware of how much i consume and how much waste i create there a lot of big stuff going on but climate change has gone away all sorts of big problems require small bits of effort from lots of people to address
i feel the same way she was way too melodramatic climate change and the people causing climate change stole her childhood pffft you been a child for years assuming her parents looked after her and did dump her in a desert she had as good of a childhood as any other kid in sweden
a recent study showed that the water around antarctica would be one of the last places to experience climate change observations and climate models show that the unique currents around antarctica continually pull deep centuries old water up to the surface seawater that last touched earth atmosphere before the machine age and has never experienced fossil fuel related climate change
what this wildfire you keep talking about in australia we have bushfires so your conclusions are inconclusive because one of your variables is wrong change adaptation publications fire regimes
what i am saying is that climate change will create planet wide gaza style crisis he very good on climate change and considering he has pro bds people working on his campaign i am not going to blame him if he does want to die on that damned hill for wokepoints
this generation is no different then the last or the one before it their are quotes dating back to the roman times about kids these days technology and social media has destroyed this generation your fear mongering and it the same tired argument that was forward about comic books rock and roll or any other societal changes beyond the minor little issue of climate change we live in a safer cleaner world in the west at least with more comfortable lives then at any point in history
hi a friendly question is climate change a concern for many of you trump supporters a lot a little not at all from a curious brit
scientific dictatorships are needed because feelings of the common folk cause our society to collapse if we cater to every whim in our society there eventually will be no society left because people and companies are way too demanding all classes of society are unwilling to change their manner of life to ensure our society and planet can survive we stuck in a long hiatus discussing what we need to change and nothing radical is actually happening big companies continue to exist humans keep reproducing everything that needs to change is extremely slow maybe we need scientists who are specialized in area such as climate change overpopulation etc to take control over our society maybe if neccessary things such as human rights should be temporarily overlooked in order to continue humanity i am not going too much into details but maybe scientists should get all the power they need in order to save and better our society
there a newspaper clip floating around reddit of an article from years ago predicting climate change due to fossil fuels especially coal i and all my life there been three big threats nuclear war overpopulation and climate change i have to admit though climate change was not taken seriously as far as i recall until i was in my
all right i concede that gold reserves are not an asset that produces income i suppose it would be considered a form of capital however it can be something used to produce income if you want an example of an australian government selling an income producing asset there are examples of particularly this government selling profit making government owned businesses and ventures particularly anything to do with climate change doing just that people were complaining about it on here for weeks
from a conservative viewpoint climate change research would be more efficient if it was done by either non profit organizations or private corporations climate change is something the federal government needs to address at least at this time i not sure about republicans at large but personally i believe that racism and sexism can only truly be addressed through education and time anecdotally i see much less racism and sexism in the youth of the nation and when they grow up they will raise their children with the same beliefs the only alternatives that i have seen proposed are affirmative actionesque policies or reprimands both of which are essentially racism in the opposite direction i was taught from a young age that two wrongs do make a right and do fight fire with fire using a racially biased system to correct the problems from the old racially biased system does not seem like an ethical solution the conservative philosophy as pointed out several times in this post is for a smaller government specifically because government is inefficient rather than have tax dollars go towards helping the less fortunate conservatives believe that charitable giving both to religious organizations and other charities is a more effective way of helping those in need what you view as undermining is most likely the republican attempts to open more opportunities for other organizations to step in and fill this role as i stated earlier conservatives do believe that the government is the best choice to solve these problems i wo say that i think the current administration or congress is doing a great job at solving any of these issues or any issues for that matter but i believe this is an opportunity for organizations companies and the local state governments to make a difference i do speak for all republicans in fact i would even consider myself one but it seems to me that the root of the problem here is the failure for either side to acknowledge that the other opinion could be valid and rational i do expect for others to conform to my point of view but i do expect that when they tell me my view is invalid they have made an honest attempt to look at it from a different perspective
look at this one from those calculations cast our work at google program in a sobering new light suppose for a moment that it had achieved the most extraordinary success possible and that we had found cheap renewable energy technologies that could gradually replace all the world coal plants a situation roughly equivalent to the energy innovation study best case scenario even if that dream had come to pass it still would have solved climate change this realization was frankly shocking not only had failed to reach its goal of creating energy cheaper than coal but that goal had not been ambitious enough to reverse climate change
yeah because people vote in conservatives who wo admit climate change is happening because it effect their wallets if we voted in more people like aoc bernie warren and inslee maybe governments could do more but instead we get donald climate change is a chinese hoax trump how does this not make sense to you also elon musk is dong more to fight climate change than any government that a gross oversimplification and you know it
wow did read the comments almost all dismiss climate change as hocus pocus
you say about mya the climate changed and it favoured cows from your comment i read this as paraphrasing my understanding being because the cows over the previous my evolved to eat what the horses did and the climate change meant that the food cows ate became more abundant so in that more recent my why have horses evolved to cope better with the available food unless i misunderstood the timescale of evolution or something else
my inner skeptic takes issue with this surely there is room for some unforeseen that could take our predicted values off the mark honestly not according to well over of scientists you can argue that the warming phase we are in is caused by humans but you ca argue it is happening figuring out how much ice will melt and how much of an effect that will have is trivial these days with satellite imaging the only way to slow it down would be if there was a huge volcano that put so much ash into the atmosphere that is caused us to lose year after year of crops for a long long time that would be even worse wait are most cities coastal why will more than of cities have to move yes it way more than too there are already small nations that know for a fact that they are going to be completely underwater in a few decades in some cases a lot less like the maldives they know for a fact they will completely erased within a generation with certainty there are a lot of interesting plans for how the island nation might be able to survive but they are not feasible for most places because they are so small should we start farming vertically now or building huge greenhouses i think we have alternatives to the way we doing things now double yes technology is our only hope really which is why we need to fix our damn education system we are going backwards in many ways of course the real danger is actual pollution look at some of the pictures of china right now to see how bad it can get and they are still getting worse
it hard to believe that just years ago there was nothing here but bush climate change is absolute crap abortion is the easy way out it hardly surprising that people should choose the most convenient exit from awkward situations jesus knew that there was a place for everything and it not necessarily everyone place to come to australia we just ca stop people from being homeless if that their choice why is the fact that women choose to end their pregnancies regarded as a national tragedy approaching the scale say of aboriginal life expectancy being years less than that of the general community i ca promise that i wo continue to embarrass people western civilisation came to this country in and i proud of that if you wanna know who to vote for i the guy with the not bad looking daughters i am as you know hugely unconvinced by the so called settled science on climate change now i know that there are some aboriginal people who are happy with australia day for them it remains invasion day i think a better view is the view of noel pearson who has said that aboriginal people have much to celebrate in this country british heritage i think there does need to be give and take on both sides and this idea that sex is kind of a woman right to absolutely withhold just as the idea that sex is a man right to demand i think they are both they both need to be moderated so to speak i think it would be folly to expect that women will ever dominate or even approach equal representation in a large number of areas simply because their aptitudes abilities and interests are different for physiological reasons i check under my bed every night for immigrants and gays out to get me i will show women scans of their babies before an abortion in an attempt to reduce the abortion rates it was much hotter when jesus was around i feel a little bit threatened by homosexuality as most people do i think everyone should have some familiarity with the great texts that are at the core of our civilisation that includes most importantly the bible it is an open question how much the climate changes today and what role man plays i think it would be impossible to have a good general education without at least some serious familiarity with the bible and with the teachings of christianity well my people skills at the time of julius caesar and jesus of nazareth the climate was considerably warmer than it is now
right yeah i was being facetious i was responding to the why posited in the article title the reason why a climate change denier will almost certainly win the gop primary in nh is because that all they got
this we ca leave things like this to the free market because there no market value in repairing the ozone there no real market value in trying to stave off or mitigate the effects of climate change because we only now beginning to feel its effects we need smart coordinated government policy for emergencies like these
it not because they do like the diet it because you are paying people to kill animals in a process that creates less food and drives climate change and species extinction
it about climate change republicans do believe in it
no ditch baby making more than one per household to fight climate change if people are entertained at home by tech at least they not driving cars around
never know anyone that did believe in climate change i have heard differing opinions on the amount caused by human activity and on what should be done about it
not really we are doing far more damage to our futures by hobbling critical spending on infrastructure combating climate change and providing basic needs for the general public than the debt will ever actually cause it a red herring in the many problems out there and obsession with it is a massive mistake
joe passed the first climate change bill ever under the reagan administration no less is a climate change denier
newer research suggests the anthropocene era that is the age of modern humans may be permanently damaging the earths ability to support complex life we have created a hole in the fucking ozone somehow for fuck sake which will take at least decades to naturally close back up if not longer as we double down on screwing ourselves we were at the crux of preventing climate change or not decades ago now all we can hope for is damage control realism is where its at though as time passes it feels more and more like pessimism every day

the elites just understand that if we actually took the measures to massively cut down carbon emissions and simultaneously draw carbon out of our atmosphere it would completely tank the global economy we would end up in full collapse faster than we will from climate change we are completely dependent on fossil fuels maybe they think that the world will have to go through a readjustment where of the population is lost and then whoever is left can focus on stabilizing the climate just a thought
rainbow shirts are satanic lol then that lucky charms guy must be the devil and skittles must be the devils favorite candy not to mention chuckles dots and jubejubes which all contain the rainbow maybe that lady does need god to live a normal healthy and happy life but god does care about race sexuality or wealth god cares about creation and wants life to be full of good vibes and happiness if god real god would be so godlike that if someone does believe in them god would be okay with that people should be attacking stores for carrying rainbows but they should be busting down wall street for their lies and crimes against humanity though why are people busy bothering the lgbqt community when they should always have been directing that energy where it belongs the federal reserves and wall street we live in a rigged economy and the stock market is manipulated yet it is supposed to be a free and fair market everything about the way the economy is setup is essentially unconstitutional and only insures the rich stay rich and keep getting richer and we live every day of our lives heavily impacted by inflation and manipulation which means we pay more so the rich get richer so when you go to a store like target things like food cost more than ago furniture clothes etc everything costs between more than last year not just this year but each and every year as well and it only picking up pace not slowing down what people should be appalled about inside of target is where all the products come from all china btw and the exorbitantly high prices from year to year the rich elites manipulate people and get lower prices from external sources shipping everything in imports and charge the people living here quadruple what it all worth meanwhile they pay people from these other countries dirt wages no wonder they do want to pay fair living wages here either when is america going to recognize the levels of corruption and protest something that matters stop fighting about rainbows start fighting wallstreet and i remember the rally but they never finished what they started imo the real devil is inside wallstreet and he wants people distracted fighting about gay pride rainbows instead of where their money goes one day it might be too late in fact it probably already is too late it at the point now where they can pick and choose who to keep or let loose who will have a normal life or end up another homeless bum with too many problems to worry about where the freedom now seems like all anyone uses their freedom for is to protest the wrong things keeping us divided divided we fail together if we stand we can win though we are a part of the why do we let the billionaires walk all over us and have everything they want spread the wealth out pay us fair living wages and get out of the way of progress a lot of these billionaires belong on that show hoarders they only repeating the same processes to generate wealth and it causing insanity they just hoard money and resources meanwhile there are still homeless starving people suffering in every country and here we are watching some guy complain about rainbows how about protest something that matters and bring people together and do something about it climate change unfair wealth distribution education bubble and technological progress those are the most important topics of this generation not who is gay or straight this is the century and i ca believe racism still exists that all propaganda to keep us from realizing the truth it does matter what we believe when we all notice what going on and see the truth if we all banded together we could literally all become rich overnight i want that financial freedom i want to share that financial freedom and i do mind who i be sharing it with that all the society should be focused on if they want to survive much longer stop destroying the world environment to selfishly hoard resources and pretend to have wealth power and control none of those concepts actually exist wealth power and control are illusions nobody can be wealthy if everyone in the world is dead from climate change
why do you believe clowns instead of scientists on the question of climate change do you question science fiction hats universally agreed upon by relevant science in other fields like evolution or gravity

i do know what he even talking about here racism that was just reportage of what an american president said they upheld a daft complaint when a tv journalist told a personal story on the grounds that it breaches their rules around impartiality i can only think that it because they do want their newsreaders to come out with personal stories all the time even though they do anyway to an extent in interviews and lighter news stories but it apparently verboten with the serious news stories brexit there are genuinely two sides which have a case and the country is genuinely split they would be representing half the country if they just adopted the remain side wholesale and promoted it as the truth if it wanted to call out lies in the name of truth in the case of brexit then it would be neutral as both sides have told lies climate change this is the only one where there actually a right and wrong answer either this is climate change or there is and it either caused by humans or it caused by something else no need for impartiality there
lol i would call a minute video a summary i more meant to look at actual scientific facts not the ramblings of one person on youtube the effects of climate change are clear to see not sure why people pretend it does not exist

it funny how the left goes on and on about how of scientists agree with climate change but when you point out that a similar proportion of economists back free trade or eliminating corporate tax or the necessity of large scale entitlement reform to keep the system fiscally soluble suddenly science is no longer something we should listen to it would jar so much if the left did take such a high and mighty position about being the side of science
from my perspective there so much wrong with the way you look at things it really beyond the scope of a couple of reddit comments to break it down you got an incredibly narrow view of the world narrow on the scale of humans as a part of a much larger system and in the scope of humanity you almost certainly a white westerner from a christian cultural tradition going from your comments i think it great you think you great by your own standards but even you got to see the problem with hand waving away species threatening climate change and massive social inequality that literally leads to millions starving to death every year i assume that you simply do care about these issues because they do touch you and yours at the moment it a very solipsistic way of living and thinking though and i feel kind of bad for you and for us all that people still think like that tbh as for killing living things it totally justified because humans and other animals need to sustain themselves we do need animals to sustain ourselves people in the western world just tell each other that because they want to eat meat or they want to sell other people meat no one needs it
the bullshit asymmetry principle perfectly explains why people oppose ubi the rich paying their fair share and doing something about climate change yes
well let see covid nope they think it a hoax climate change and wildfires we are dealing with nope that the ca governors fault for not raking the forest better like finland working with the rest of the world nope america first but luckily the rest of the world does think like that and we have countries like mexico whose firefighters are coming to help on their own dime racial injustice nope it not looking to promising but i keep thinking about and will update
bruh he went from rapping about climate change and oil drilling to conspiracy theories about vaccines and bill gates i would genuinely like to see a left wing critique that is well thought out but it just facebook meme talking points and cringe cancel culture dude is defiantly chasing views and probably never solidly had a core understating of politics to begin with
i actually also know a couple engineers who are very conservative none of these guys are climate change deniers but from what i can tell their political views are mostly about taxes and protecting what theirs actually now that i think about it they are all senior engineers who are easily earning a figure salary also i think someone vote for president and how they might potentially vote in congress is a false equivalence in congress they are voting issue by issue whereas with president it more of a pick one of two people that is closest to your views deal also anecdotal evidence but i know someone who is liberal and extremely religious he leans left on almost all social and economic issues but continues to vote republican just because of abortion
nan
tell me what are your stances on climate change
this is why i do mind climate change i could go for some climate change how much worse can it get than desert very desert psh the increased temperature will mean more water evaporates that means more rain everywhere the rest of the world gets destroyed with crazy superstorms and we get a bit more rain land value here skyrockets i build a guest house and rent it out for three times the mortgage while thanking obama for not doing more and trump for putting america first
i worried about this before i had my son but honestly the way i see it if we care this much about our children and the world we live in who to say that this is exactly the kind of answer the world needs parents who raise a generation of compassionate enviro conscious future adults does sound so wrong and unfair my son will know about climate change how black lives matter how women and men are equal and how to know true evil and true good when they see it i will teach him to speak up and to try to leave everywhere he goes a better place than when he arrived do you see that this is actually how we may yet have reason to hope for our world maybe it be ok after all
that does change the fact that this deal is shit for the china is classed as a developing country this means the us is expected to give them money and free use of patents towards renewable energy there no enforcement mechanism but the us does generally honor those agreements then china gets to use any method to manufacture those renewable resources even ones that have a negative net carbon impact on the environment then turn around and sell them to the us so the us can meet its goals it really a shitty agreement that encourages net harm to the environment sticking the us with the bill if trump was an idiot he could attack it on those points but it would piss off his base to not simply deny climate change as a myth
seeing posts like this fills me with so much despair climate change is going to destroy the world i never have enough money to do anything except scrape by and they just sit there writing fucking articles like this which show how little they care about the realities of people lives some days i just want to cry fuck me
but when climate change denial becomes the official policy of the most powerful nation on earth we may not survive the next years
the worst case climate change projection is that bad droughts and famines will be more common disease spread by insects will become more common there will be mass migration from the equators towards the poles and severe poverty will become far worse millions if not billions of people will die obviously this is horrible but it not like humans will go extinct it not even that human civilization would collapse and that the worse case projection it from a report disputed by climate scientists for not being peer reviewed and overstating the impact many climate change activists justify overstating the impact of climate change by saying it does matter we need to act immediately and if imagining the statue of liberty up to her neck in water gets people motivated then great but the difference between billion people dying and billion humans dying is enormous the difference between of humans dying and of humans dying is also enormous ultimately you can think climate change is a big deal but the us president can easily bring about conditions that kill far more people far more rapidly for example hyper nationalism can bring about conflict between nuclear armed states defunding foreign aid and local public health organizations the cdc can bring about a global pandemic also destabilizing states leads to terrorism which increases the possibility of biological terrorism if you are really concerned about the entire planet ability to sustain human life as a species then these other concerns are more important
useless link to a locked blog post so maybe edit your post with something vaguely useful to the discussion anyway the gaia hypothesis is a half century old scientific theory from the renowned climate researchers james lovelock and lynn margulis both prominent in their fields respectively chemistry and microbiology that the earth is a self regulating biome that works with a multifaceted biological intelligence is less a new idea than science catching up in the to the reality of large biological systems margulis work in particular scaled up from her speciality microbiology just as modern science was beginning to comprehend the complex web of biological societies within larger animals shocks to the system such as extinction events asteroid crashes rapid climate change etc upsets these systems which work on a longer time scale than the changes wrought by catastrophes still the inherent intelligence of the earth biome eventually corrects and adjusts to the externally caused reality although that can be as in the famous case of the dinosaurs the end of most forms of dominant animal life only a few such as the theropods that evolved and branched out into modern birds survived that ecosystem collapse along with infinite insects and the early mammals that we descend from
what are you taking about people who die like all people out of human beings on the earth are people of color so by default all climate related deaths from climate change will be disproportionately people of color the poor etc china and india represent billion human beings who are people of color and they have done better managing the affects of covid than the entire western hemisphere the vast majority of people who have died or been affected from covid in the us were white non hispanics sheesh really
china already has lower per capita emissions than a lot of the world historically they done horrible ecological destruction but they are now on the frontline of combating climate change things like carbon capture evs de desertification public transit etc are all areas where china does a great job i know this reddit and you ca say anything good about china but india needs to learn from their neighbor in that area
none of that matters right now you see they not thinking about that at all we at the point of a global recession right now i not talking about us inflation and china slowing economy i talking about global and a massive food shortage due to ukraine these are dangerous times and we are no longer at a point of worrying about climate change or supply chains to that extent anymore things are getting hot on the geopolitical playing field between nuclear powers that with one miss calculation can cost the world everything
denying climate change leading to catastrophes in the future throwing gays off a building for me the first one is more dangerous than the second

the climate could get worse the french economy is kind of crap they need unpopular reforms eu and non eu mass immigration continues society is divided automation will remove even more jobs the eu still lacks democratic legitimacy i mean i hope macron can fix some things but there is no guarantee and if he fails then le pen will be even stronger did you hear her speech last night she did look like a loser at all in fact is seemed like everything went as planned she is now a major force in france and will basically play the opposition for the next few years my guess is that she will become a bit more moderate use the many young voters that supported her to change her image we will see but this is over yet
so economic viability is proto later this century does that sound like it really not worth focusing our efforts on until we manage climate change
i sure it cheaper to buy non meat products you wrong i mean if you poor why not just not eat meat anyway you presumptuous the contribution to climate change is less growing crops you wrong yes fuck you your lazy unscrupulous attitude sucks fuck you too
the typical response of the liberal establishment is to shift the responsibility of any social problem to the individual especially when that problem is rooted in systems of power this in effect neuters all change as the individuals who partake in making a change are the ones who control the systems causing the problems in the first place climate change middle class can recycle oil companies can pollute police brutality shame the middle class for racism existing cops can brutalize prisons can exploit labor do actually talk about are police and definitely do talk about prisons or the amendment
kirsten hello zsmg i think that the election results give a kind of difficult situation like in when it was difficult to form a coalition this is not so surprising germans do not really like change many voters want to continue to live like they do and are afraid of some kind of sacrifices for example to protect the climate concerning akk annegret kramp karrenbauer she was very much affected by the dramatic end of the afghanistan mission and i do not think that her result would have been much better alex hi zsmg and thank you for your question i think the biggest surprise was as much in the numbers than in the dynamic after the first numbers were out fdp boss lindner made it clear quickly and publicly on live tv that he wanted to talk to the greens in order so find common ground it almost sounded like they would then decide which of the big parties the two of them would form a government with which is an uncommon way to go about considering both parties are the junior partners another surprise was that laschet said he wanted to form a government even though the numbers of the cdu were at an all time low he was under a lot of pressure after from his own party after this
it definitely subversive or deconstructive in a way later on in the comics the characters realize they simply putting out fires and maintaining the status quo rather than enacting any real change as superheroes it delves into a bunch of storylines of them actually trying to solve things like world hunger climate change overpopulation and dealing with the consequences and moral dilemnas that come with their efforts
i am rooting for climate change
i think it a really good idea something near future that kind of brings into light climate change new technology and a push into space it would be near enough to be rooted in hard sci fi but far away enough to avoid all the controversy that people are worried about
here the thing i feel as if i ca really talk about climate change with anyone in the same way that you ca say the word clinton without making people automatically feel a certain way i get the impression that climate change has been politicized to the point that many are even willing to indulge a discussion regarding it to many it is an issue that will affect the entire human race it a topic it an ideological battleground with plenty of room for diverse opinions with most of those opinions originating from people who breathe bias and live to serve corporate interests of course you ca say anything close to this because then you a communist or some shit
i very happy and as someone who used to be suicidal because i was convinced i was worthless and my life was never going to improve i am so happy i never went through with it i have a great job that i used to worry about keeping because i was on contract but we just finalized the paperwork to make me permanent last week so that a huge weight off my shoulders i in a relationship with a wonderful man i plan on spending the rest of my life with who makes me really happy and is a great companion i have a dog and a cat that i adore even though they crazy i have a big backyard where i can garden i live in a nice home where i have everything i need in a great community with wonderful neighbours i slowly but surely working towards advancing my career because after years of uncertainty i think i figured out what i want to do i make decent money i have no debt i get substantial time off to pursue my hobbies and hang with friends and family and i on track to retire before i the only part of my life that i change is canada climate because i actually love the country i live in the weather is just shit for half of the year but that about it i feel pretty lucky
people need to hear the good news about climate change like what that it will all be over much sooner than we thought
what the point of keeping any creature around other than humans i not arguing to kill off animals i questioning your rationale how should we choose which creatures to save and which to let die because to me it seems like the logical extension to your argument is that if an animal can not survive climate habitat change we should just let it die do nothing about any animals presumably unless the animal is directly beneficial to human civilisation for food
this is ahistorical the only people who have been underserved lol by law are descendants of slaves not native americans not hispanics like dreamers who have never known their supposed homeland with all due respect you do know enough to have this discussion are you sure or are you just unwilling to discuss it beginning to provide the infrastructure and basic services that others already enjoy are basic rights of citizenry and should not and can not be used as reparations i feel like you projecting your emotions off me instead of reading what i said let me clarify i do think reparations are effective policy effective policy are fundamental changes in the structure of our government that can get the support to be passed into law the fundamental changes i advocate for are ones that empower the black community to better their own positions which would help change the political climate and possibly make reparations feasible in terms of supporting votes in other words instead of thinking of these things as either or i think of them as step step etc how would you place these steps in order to most effectively help immediately and help further change i also feel like you ignored this sentence although i would agree they are deserved beginning to provide the infrastructure and basic services that others already enjoy are basic rights of citizenry ok is that the problem america is equal if we thought of this as debt towards the black community is it better to pay off the debt while still rapidly incurring more debt or is it better to fix the problem of us incurring debt in the first place and then pay off the remaining debt if it a matter of sending a check or fixing the inequality still present the latter seems more important to me and easier to get support for as well
not to play devil advocate or act like i do believe in climate change because i definitely do and i know we are at fault as a civilization but if we had nt fucked everything up with fossil fuels the last hundred years or so would those glaciers look exactly the same how they were years ago or would they have naturally melted down on their own regardless of any human intervention

are actors billionaires i do simp for anyone in this capatalist hellhole regardless being annoyed that rich actors are making stories to create conversations about climate change idk it is much better than another emily in paris art and movies and shows are gon na stop being made and actors ai gon na stop acting maybe our worship culture around actors will change fingers crossed if we all work towards it but i am still grateful for those actors for making art like this and i can still hold them accountable for the ways they contribute to the issue
cliff mass is also verging on climate denier status no no he not cliff mass biggest fault is talking about climate change with laymen in the same way that climate scientists talk about climate change with fellow scientists he gives people like you too much credit thinking that surely you adopt the same kind of careful skeptical attitude and drive to know what really happening even if it does align with your politics that makes for a good scientist
denying evolution anthropogenic climate change or any other controversial overwhelming scientific consensus
alarmism at its finest also i could sworn i saw a figure that states the us has cut the most emissions compared to other countries combatting climate change
i not saying it would cause any trouble but it ultimately is how balancing works considering what human interference has led to so far i just do not have much faith in these matters it also always boiling down to let murder something it also often a matter of animals ending up in a place where they do belong because their original habitat got ruined due to human interference likely climate change with hunting deer there also no real endgame where you can just leave them alone i also think r debateavegan comments is true with that humans have just been terrible with trying to maintain this if anyone will be selling the dead dear i do have faith it going to practically work out in best faith for nature

i concerned that he gives flat earthers credence by pulling them into debates as if not having information was the problem with them then has the gall to shit on the one sci fi hit movie gravity for being inaccurate no shit it inaccurate it was made by a famously imaginative director he has toned down recently but time was when he was ruining things all over the place with agshually comments and i have no problem with him shitting on ignorant opinions if they matter climate change deniers need to be put in place and i am all for it
when i say trustworthy news sources good points the point i trying to make is that until technological developments occur to counter act this what would those be the best defence is critical thinking and going to sources that have been consistently reliable that where i skeptical education is in a terrible state and it has been shown that many just use their education to retroactively justify pre established beliefs even in the face of countering evidence not only is there a lack of education but massive efforts at actively producing ignorance or perhaps unknowledge is a more appropriate term that is to unlearn what was already learned over a billion is spent every year on spreading misinformation around climate change alone capitalism is not only self destructive but it actively undermining humanity ability to adapt
you do get to make an argument from numbers pick the wrong numbers and then claim it makes no difference make an attempt to do the math correctly or do do it first it made no difference so yes i get to say it made no difference because it was a rounding error on something that is already well beyond immeasurable second i have read anything about a cut to levels that sounds stupid to say but considering this is climate science it par for the course and i should be surprised in no possible scenario can a cut of it is closer to a cut and if what you say was true the proponents of this would have been screaming from the rooftops which is why i call bullshit citation needed third i used the ipcc figure for billion and yes it would have been something like a year per person in reality it costed the average person at least in increased living costs per year change repealing carbon tax again par for the course in climate science they were only off by orders of magnitude and that is not even considering that emissions actually went up

i ca help but notice that in your response you never once try to say trump does operate this way and if you can only say that antifa is just as bad as the potus what does that say about him or about how low your standards have gotten you then equate all of this to the left as if the people literally protesting in masks are following the exact same playbook as lifelong politicians really i mean here pelosi and gingrich agreeing to address climate i do see either of them just attacking the person they do like of course if you keep watching the video you see what the republican party does when you try to set aside your differences and compromise with them
most of the people who are in the republican death cult are there because of their outrage at all of the demographic and cultural changes in century america shifts that are fundamentally and irrevocably changing their once safe world they ca face the new challenges the new american identity climate change universal rights for all americans the list goes on and on century america is here and it will never go back to their dream version they sense this deep in their reactionary brains and in their fearful desperation they will latch on to anything or anyone who will help them in their quest to stop change it an old old story in the history of humankind their war against change has already been lost but they will continue to fight battles about their version of freedom and what they perceive to be their special rights for years to come yes they are even willing to sacrifice themselves and their children in what they perceive to be the greatest cause of their lives that is preserving their particular version of america that what makes them so dangerous in the short term

i would buy up as much land around the world as possible to then have as many trees planted on said land as possible to rejuvenate the ecosystems of said places and to fight climate change
i not sure what you mean by actual environmentalism the act of protecting the planet its denizens and ensuring a clean well environment for humanity are you implying that climate change would embolden us to care about the planet more than we do now implying that it emboldens us to do the opposite not being real by your presumptions by truth surely concerns of leaving a habitable planet for future generations is a part of actual environmetalism no there are no such concerns among the agw crowd environmentalism is the facade for their machinations
climate change
that exactly what happening but the global news headline says they dead due to climate change they were dead the minute they were born due to peoples ravenous appetite for flesh

we are ok with systematic and cultural discrimination against minorities we do want women and medical proefssionals to make decisions for themselves we want the vast majority of americans to pay for huge tax cuts to the most wealthy we want to deregulate industries that have already taken advantage of americans to the point of massive economic damage we all for polluting the environment so future generations ca survive and we absolutely do want americans to have high quality or affordable healthcare but climate change is definitely real these fucking people
well basically whenever i do something wrong like wake him up in the morning on accident he starts screaming at me and telling me to shut up and that i stupid but when i get angry the slightest like saying that he should be angry all the time he gets even more angry and i honestly want to punch him in the face i have no idea what you mean by waking him up in the morning on accident but i assume whatever i want okay if someone acts like they clean and dry they probably clean and dry you in a conflict he views his anger as his instrument for winning and if he thinks you threaten to take that away he thinks it a threat this is the same reason why supporters of war use the traitorous critic fallacy a lot he not playing to agree with you he trying to win you in a lose lose situation that he thinks is a lose situation he thinks that anything anyone says other than to be unkind to you is blaming him for whatever he says or thinks is happening such conflicts are very vain to win conflicts like this and stay in something you need to recruit allies and look good before them you ca reason with such people there nothing that can ever u your relationship with him and the situation needs to change and the only way that can ever happen is if there are no people there the situation perpetuates itself by making people losers that are too pathetic and scared to leave the situation is a climate of b emotions such as fear of being alone or ignored he not your job you not even supposed to be in the region he not there to accept help from you and you are not there to help him he not there to help you and you not there to accept help from him they might offer you material gain power matchmaking services or attention but none of it is ever worth it and none of it is ever likely to survive this situation the situation will likely perish soon and when it does all therein will meet some sort of unkind and pointless fate you in a dysfunctional home and prison is another dysfunctional home where people that started out in such homes wind up therefore being from that home is a crime and being there any longer is an extenuating factor in this offense you not learning anything interesting there and this is absolutely terrible for your physical health if there is such a thing as mental illness this kind of domestic absurdity is a leading cause of why there is such a thing the police ca help you they based on going over there and attacking someone to try to earn the badass cred they want domestic disputes are contemptible and weak so policing does really apply to it the presence of assholes like your father in the region means that the region has a sick contemptible and weak culture power sides with what passes for your father power every enterprise is based on money power and sometimes attention including the social worker office and above all the police social workers offices and police organizations have different rationales the rationale of the social worker office is for the government to make concessions out of realpolitik and if they intrinsically motivated there some trust and sympathy too if they do trust you they will call the police police attention is something that happens to people like us a lot the police are motivated by vanity and are motivated by fear of being alone or ignored that why they have buildings full of people that ca leave and it why they use force and interrogations to get people in there because it gets attention the police want to be seen as badass and they have to earn it by going around looking for a fight and for people they can bring in and interrogate and find a way to make them look guilty of something so that they do have to be alone or ignored ever again criminals fall for it because they want to be made to pay for their offenses by being locked up because criminals have the exact same motivations plus a lot of them want to be in prison to get more access to contraband domestic disputes are contemptible and weak and the police know that their enemies perceive it that way and that their fans do see it as badass however the police might respond to a domestic dispute and when a child is a party to that dispute police are rigged against the kid never talk with your father and since you are likely to do so pick up safe topics that you ca use against you never tell him anything important comment secret nor personal never try to reason with him be silent when anyone confronts you especially him all of that is why you need to leave into something that is prison and why the police wo help you you need the trust of social workers that why never tell a social worker that they do get it or that they do feel that way never bring up the concept of any means necessary with a social worker to leave you may have to make a lot of sacrifices and difficult decisions i used to be a cute kid and now i a loser and maybe even a sociopath maybe i can do a menial job but i never be able to f properly it all because i failed to get out fast enough advisors do really like to appeal to fear and make ultimatums a lot but the unstated assumption when someone uses a shift response when giving advice is follow the adviser instructions now or else this will happen to you too so just leave now even if you not yet you probably wo be allowed to leave so smuggle your journal into a social worker office until the police allow you to leave or you years old if anyone finds out about the journal it gone start adulting immediately do not care very much how people perceive you since you trying to leave perception is not as valuable as if you were fighting to stay run if you able and if you not doing and flinching walk away from his explosion in any case do get caught leaving and if you do get caught leaving leave anyway you need a social worker
i never said you did it was sarcasm so much has happened i forgot about the epa rollbacks with climate change ramping up it a big deal
as scary as climate change is people reactions to it are just as big a concern once it becomes clear to everyone that nature is bitch slapping us hard how do people respond i think we are already seeing it with the rise of fear based politics around the globe things could get real ugly the people with their heads in the sand are maddening but once even they face reality do count on them joining the side of reason and compassion
it undeniable that the scale of belief in baseless conspiracy theories is much larger in the us the only major political party in the world to deny anthropogenic climate change they elected a conspiracy nut for president who rose to political prominence on the back of a conspiracy theory which btw in of gop voters still could say obama was born in the blogs ballot box presidential poll majority of republicans still doubt obamas this was five years after obama released his birth certificates and trump had not produced any of the evidence he promised
please enlighten me then or feel free to ask what my beliefs are rather than telling me what they are climate change the optimal way of limiting emissions is to make small and dense cities someone who believe in climate change and who want to act upon it should move to a dense city believing in survivalism the optimal strategy in that case is to move far from civilization in a place where you can grow your own food believing that the usa was better under the rule of england a lot of people moved when the usa became independent i think i have enough examples we do believe in enforcing individual justice universally regardless of one personal views by that logic the war in afghanistan was justified legitimate authority is derived from equal rights not everyone believe in the same rights this is why governments exists with rights comes responsibilities and again not everyone believe in the same responsibilities thus justifying the need of a government we only oppose illegitimate authority you imposing your point of view of what is or is a legitimate authority to people that are perfectly fine with the current authority
have been for a year climate change is a thing recall
the long term effects are that it is too late and that most life on this planet is going to die if you bring water to a boil you will burn yourself if you stick your hand in it if you take the water off the heat you will still burn yourself if you stick your hand in it people do not understand momentum nor do they understand that was enough to change the climate we not only have to stop contributing we have to reduce it and sadly we will never reduce it fast enough to prevent the catastrophe personally i think we should give up on preventing climate change and start building game reserves in an effort to save all the species which will be under threat of being wiped out for the rednecks that do like people from the middle east be prepared to welcome a billion of them when they have to flee their homeland
could be double talk to pretty much any reasonable person at this point climate change is a proven theory the evidence is overwhelming
when neither are vegetarians it would be silly to push a political culinary agenda that neither espouses at a state dinner if we ignore the potential for technological developments research also indicates that we have little hope of successfully addressing the climate change threat unless we give up motorized transportation but nobody is suggesting that trudeau bike to the white house
because they are often blamed for decimating songbird populations which is like blaming volcanoes for climate change
cons are not pushing climate change denial you just lying and liberals are acting on it in any meaningful way so if that your concern you shit out of luck voting liberal do you think people are going to care more or less about climate change when they are all starving and homeless because of the liberals policies
it an issue everywhere travel has introduced lots of invasive seeds people move plants animals pests environment can always benefit from stuff like that commenter said adding more native flora helps the local insect and animal bird populations whose food sources have been dwindling like the monarch butterfly with milkweed so much land has been destroyed for development insect species are going extinct because of climate change it has already started so food sources are disappearing throughout the food chain as species die out it was a bit odd to throw that in without context under a bird identification but they got their heart in the right place and helpful energy
nah man those boomers fucked us with climate change so it ok if they die though
that would be irresponsible of us to be able to commit to that she also repeated the government claims that it would meet its emissions reduction targets so ms price how do you plan on reducing emissions cost if you going to continue with the consumption of coal what happens if the experts were in fact correct and we have the technology that can generate clean good electricity it is much more irresponsible when you the environment minister yet you sit on your fat arse doing nothing to actively change the dwindling state of australia you continue to do nothing and yet you still have this delusion that everything honky dory german environment minister svenja schulze said we must not lose any more time on climate protection and french energy minister francois de rugy said the report contained sad conclusions that amounted to a call to action addressed to the world labor shadow climate and energy minister mark butler said the government response to the un report proved it was incapable of taking the action we need to protect the interests of our children and grandchildren he added these are the world most qualified scientists who are briefed by the nations of the world to provide advice on this question but hey what do the so called experts know what does the un know what does mark butler know possibly nothing right ms price
no it does remind some people of their inaction in this case they probably actively stopped people working on solutions to climate change from getting to work just so they could masturbate on their own self righteousness
are you asking if christina hoff sommers denies climate change or are you attempting to dismiss her video by linking her to an organization that she may scientifically and academically agree disagree with on all sorts of things because it seems like you going for the latter which could be less scientific watch the video challenge her points directly otherwise everyone knows you a hack with an emotion not an educated individual with a point

climate change is not a crisis but we do need to adapt and stop making it political it real the dysfunctional hyperbole in wholly unnecessary
research follows money money generally likes climate change it a shame the way conservative causes like climate change denial suffer for a lack of backing from the wealthy and powerful
imagine not thinking climate change is real when we not getting consistently cool weather until mid late november i could swear as a kid that the first half of the school year late august to the new year was always cool and the hot days did come until the end of the school year early mid june
dude this is a drought it climate change the rain not coming back wells are running dry all around the country at least in the southwest in the southwest western texas is also running low on water i think this is just going to be our new normal which means a ton of people are going to try and move to the midwest and to the northeast and guess what there plenty of water right now for the people who live there but if we have a million people trying to settle in the area prices are going to go up and we gon na have the same problem because guess what tornado alley is moving east east have been for the last years coinciding with the drought this is climate change we gon na have a problem majorly soon
simplest do nothinhg it will collapse of its own accord within a few decades as climate change gets worse and continues to take its toll

i do think that actually solves the problem though since the effects of climate change generally are so diffuse and multi causal sure it protects the people down stream of a chemical factory but who do pacific islanders sue when their island slips beneath the waves
the mountainous peninsula of italy will be entirely underwater you sure about that i no climate change denier but sacramento ca will be underwater before most of italy excluding the po river valley is
this is a great analogy to explain not only climate change but statistics in general
you joke but they did this shit with climate change for decades
many are impacted by the polls many dems are educated but they are also afraid of a republican winning because it would have ramifications for climate change scotus and just about every socially liberal cause people are torn between believing every media outlet is bias or the internet is just a big echo chamber of delusion for bernie when they see iowa and nh go sanders bigger than expected they will let themselves feelthebern until then i do think it wise to disregard the media even then it needs to be respected it is still the main source for boomers and today online information sources are fragmented for first genxers so often they are terrible maybe for most people the quest for truly up to date and unbiased information seems slippery and quickly changing
is that kind of the issue though it only makes sense to me that if water is being used to such an extent that rivers dry up and reservoirs draw down more so under climate change water is going to get expensive and lots of people farmers and urban people alike wo be able to or wo want to front the bill
yes the cartoon includes a note about which is sort of clever but it does address what happens when there too much the rest of the cartoon is not informative it just a fantasy of a blonde mother earth who sides with climate change denial spanking a young woman who says climate change is real
you do drive need to trucks to physically stay alive you do need to eat meat to physically stay alive eating meat been in our nature what does that mean exactly i can argue treating women badly has been in our nature does mean i need to act like my cavemen ancestors did it a fact of life and that one organism will eat another simply to stay alive and it another fact of life that we have access to hundreds of types of grains fruits and vegetables bernie is still the most viable candidate out there regarding climate change that what i said i did say i do take bernie seriously i said i do take him seriously on this specific issue i agree with him in everything else basically my primal instincts are going meat good your primal instincts do influence facts and the facts are that the meat industry is a major contributor to climate change you can remain eating and liking meat all you want facts wo change you can even say you do care about climate change at all you within your right but if you act like you extremely concerned with an issue i expect your actions to reflect your position
imho it time for opposition leader albanese to stand up and earn his chops as they say when faced with a crisis part of being a leader is knowing when to hold and when to fold relevant unwritten rules in order to respond effectively besides it not like morrison and his ilk would do the same to him if the situation were reversed they would have a chorus of papers backing them too imho albanese should meet with the fire chiefs that morrison refuses to meet talk about climate change its effects and the imperative to act visibly visit support advocate for the communities affected and grandstand the pm to show he is of leadership material and that morrison is if he lets morrison dictate the rules of engagement for this crisis and then expects the next federal election to just fall into his lap i expect he will be sorely mistaken the battle for perceived electability is a marathon not a last minute dash
do you think the left right axis shifts based on public opinion the guardian is a centrist paper that is socially liberal the actual left working with moderates has not historically gone well the guardian environmental coverage is always framed around green capitalism they basically just promote xr and hand wring about capitalist excess without advocating structural change capitalism is built on endless growth which is antithetical to climate conservation
i agree the title is extremely misleading ocean acidification is one of the big concerns for coral reefs it interferes with the chemical process of calcification which is how stony corals mollusks some algae and other organisms form their hard structures the calcium carbonate they produce will be weaker and deformed which is not only extremely problematic for the animal but over time would decrease the reefs ability to protect our coastlines from wave action if the scales tip too far the other direction it has the potential to actively dissolve existing structures the ocean absorbing is not helping to protect us from climate change it is actually making our reefs less resilient to climate change
he is more likely to accuse antifa of intentionally burning his house down instead of acknowledging the role that climate change has in these fires

i do think ridicule is necessarily the answer but i also do think most of the people wearing no mask in public places or wearing a thin mask but only over their mouth are doing it because they fully understand the science but they have asthma anxiety panic disorders i think most of the noncompliance is due to explicit political misinformation my personal encounters with family coworkers acquaintances who refuse to wear a mask or only partially cover their faces have been entirely motivated by political misinformation i think judging someone walking through ikea and touching merchandise with their mask on their chin and a maga hat proudly displayed as an asshole is entirely appropriate i think if a coworker refuses to wear a mask because they say they wo be able to breathe when they have never had lung problems or anxiety problems in the past and that same person spouts climate change denial every day or claims that mask mandates are just anti trump propaganda that coworker is an asshole i think that if a politician walks up to the podium with a mask on rips it off and yells i ca breathe into the microphone that person is an asshole there are definitely cases where wearing a mask is as simple as it is for the rest of us due to medical factors specific to that person the number of such cases is very small the rest of us should even need a mandate to force us to wear masks we should appreciate our responsibility to take care of each other by taking the few small efforts we can to help public safety wash your hands thoroughly and frequently stay away from other people as much as possible and when you have to be near other people wear ply cloth over your nose and mouth
individual changes in aggregate can lead to large scale impacts but most individuals do not have the level of influence over other people decisions that would be required to actually cause a reduction in the amount of animals being killed whether enough people make the changes necessary to affect a large scale problem is completely out of my hands and thus does not change my moral calculus animal agriculture is immoral you are not morally responsible for things you have no influence over my purchasing decisions have little to no influence on large scale animal agriculture my purchasing decisions have little to no impact on other people large scale purchasing decisions therefore i have little to no moral responsibility to not buy products of large scale animal agriculture you could make the argument that even minuscule contributions to large scale problems bear moral weight but i think that would result in an untenable moral system that impossible to consistently live by given the extent to which we all contribute in small ways to a variety of large scale problems the environmentalist vegan you mention would have to evaluate and change almost every facet of their daily life if they wanted to apply their principles consistently are they responsible for child labor in the congo because their phone is made with cobalt or climate change because they turn the lights on at night they not allowed to buy meat but are they allowed to spend their money at stores that employ meat eaters knowing they are contributing to the wages of people who will spend them on meat products i do think it realistic or feasible to live under such a system and once you start making exemptions for some things then the whole thing sort of crumbles
what accomplishments she did nothing but said adults bad and the world is ending its not brave talking about climate change and in protest she is skipping school which she just admitted did nothing

what do you personally think should be done to fight climate change
who the fuck is laughing at climate change scientists i know people disagree with them but who the hell actively laughs at them
go to that place a few years back before committing to my current job i wanted to have the big journey and i always wanted an off the grid experience something where i could be found even if someone came searching for me at the time i had finished the first life is strange in the somewhat recent past and the feeling of max amp chloe story and the northern west coast never left me i also a cold climate kind of guy so i decided on british columbia in canada packed my buddy and booked a there and back ticket with two months in between that were absolutely completely empty we landed and had only given ourselfves a few days of leeway in a hostel before we had to find something from then on we went with friendly people camped on random camping sites looked for hosts with work somewhere in the state riding greyhound busses and slowly crept towards the rockies where we ended up just in time for autumn i did find life is strange arcadia bay but stardew valley of all things of all the things i was and was expecting this still flabbergasts me to this day the d√©j√† vu on that tiny island somewhere north at vancouver island was unreal my time there is certainly among the most treasured memories i have it was only two weeks but we somehow ended up knowing every person there and probably visited half the living rooms and lawns exchanging stories and drinking homemade brews and teas oh that was quite the rambling haha i had some expectation as to how i could change and grow but i could anticipate just how much i ended up changing this kind of journey really opens up a part of yourself that you never see anyway else the moth ooh i impressed that is amazing what did you write about
ben carson is a great surgeon to my knowledge he still denies evolutjon climate change and has said that we vaccinate too much so while he is a great surgeon he is scientifically ignorant on many subjects

i still waiting on these doomsday to come true espoused by the environmental movement previous predictions and causes include a world famine and mass death due to overpopulation b the fear of nuclear radiation leak from power plants ending in absolute annihilation c the melting of the ozone layer causing cancers and deformed babies and a heating of the surface of the earth d climate uncontrollable warming due to emissions now climate change the uncertainty and questions questions a the earths climate goes thru heating and cooling trends constantly the earths climate changes over thousands or millions of years well documented in geology the earth recently considering we are talking always earths time not human lifespan has gone thru an ice age then a warming trend into the current period before modern humans existed and during zero human emissions so is the current warming of the earth which is not warming everywhere but is causing ice cap erosion and ocean warming due to human activity and is emissions the main cause or even an accelerant this is still an open question however i do not deny it may have human contribution nor do i deny human pollution and carbon is probably a bad footprint lol b if the climate does warm will this cause disaster for the globe or humanity this is not known if the change is gradual like thousands of years or millions as it has been before there a lot that can be speculated will it continue till earth is a fireball lol doomsday or will it slow or will humans even be using carbon tech in years c even if we suppose the climate is warming due to human activity and carbon emissions not certain proved fact of science but a developing theory then why do you suppose government is the solution to this problem does government usually cause human tech to advance it is that the creative power of economics and a free exchange of ideas that causes this do you suppose that a governor or president has an answer for the problem and even if the united states bans carbon emissions modern economies run on carbon it just how it is it a cheap resource that has proven cost effective and reliable for the production and transport of most goods and services the economic destruction caused in the west mass starvation economic ruin may not even help the earth emissions china and developing countries are much dirtier running have fewer options since producing power from sources other than carbon is not yet cost effective d if the earth is warming due to the only way to create a solution to it would be a cheap energy source that produces no pollution so far that a thought dream not yet discovered electric cars use electricity that create that power thru carbon or nuclear both which environmentalists scorn solar power is expensive unreliable and produces little by comparison wind is an absolute joke so as of now we need an inventor or great scientist to find some new secret not yet unleashed e the discovery of future tech regarding energy may actually be stymied by an economic meltdown due to abandoning carbon fuel no investors in new tech no wealth to waste on experimentation also if government is put in charge they may pay friends contracts for solar but deny a new tech any funding because politicians do understand these things like an engineer or scientist also climate change fits very neatly into the left wing rhetoric regarding greedy corporations poison us so it suspicious without proof and because it become political it is not interested in truth but coalition building political power winning elections getting funding that stuff has little to do with science or truth empirically speaking so there a lot of questions and some bad motivation problems in the whole climate change debate that makes any conclusion harder to come to than we got ta save the planet pass a law also in suggestion if your going to solve climate change you need to be einstein not a voter wanting the government to gift it to you lol but honestly the world runs on energy carbon is the energy source that is cost effective produces energy and is understood and created if you wanna stop emissions you need to be a scientist and engineer who makes a discovery not an advocate for change but an actual vehicle of it
i hope people are broadly starting to understand the seriousness of climate change first high prices next shortages why are we not systemically confronting this threat by agressively reducing the primary driver fossil fuel extraction and burning here in canada we are still pressing on with the dirtiest and most resource intensive fossil fuel projects on earth the tar sands why are we continuing down this path it is madness
all i am asking is that you fools allow the free flow of information to convince the vast majority of people that vaccines are the right choice for them rather than forcing people against their will to submit to your whims because that does work very well there still people who disbelieve the holocaust and the moon landing we have people who insist that climate change is happening or that you can cure disease by praying really really hard i ok with delusions of that kind by and large because people with those delusions are unlikely to make my ill on account of their own idiocy and the idea of public health is hardly a whim it pretty solid scientific practice
point is it been years since the last time pointing at the heat in july as evidence of climate change is stupid
the human race will undergo a catastrophe that will kill to of the current population anti vaxxers and climate change deniers will be amongst the survivors
beyond that we going to see mass migration due to the effects of climate change anyway i stopped reading at that point we should all be adapting how we live to best ecological standards and that means developing more sustainable communities with room for refugees nothing about that necessitates adding more children i would always recommend adoption first as it would minimize overall suffering by removing an existing child from a tenuous situation but i think it bizarre at best to try to deny people the moral right to procreation even if it writ large some people have a stronger desire to do so and general parenting aptitude and if they vegan then the kid will be raised with at least one worthwhile moral precept i think socially normalizing and easing access to being child free through contraceptives and safe abortions should be plenty people are busy and kids are hard
since the given up on the complex real world and built a simpler fake world ie the matrix where control over the masses is exerted by influencing people feelings rather than by using reason and logic for anyone who doubts this just check out any election campaign from the last years light on facts issues heavy on pumping up emotions same thing goes for all major news stories ukraine heavy on emotions climate change facts figures presented mainly for emotional effect case numbers and other stats presented mainly for emotional effect fear
well that cool and all but bear in mind that you have no business looking down your nose at anybody who evaluates things differently i not about to risk my life so that cletus can understand that the holocaust happened and that the planet is undergoing climate change and that masks help to prevent the spread of coronavirus cletus can fuck off it not worth the little time i have on this planet
it already happening internet bill of rights and freedoms online censorship via edict without today current restraints sc ruling that fed jurisdiction can interfere with provincial jurisdiction if it a national emergency ergo covid climate change racism etc is national emergency and if everything an emergency can do anything remember the person diagnosed with climate change sc ruling that religious rights can be violated if the damage is small enough and for the greater good buh bye charter of rights and freedoms financial institutions like paypal chase wells fargo already ban users accounts based on political affiliation and online social presence it only get worse from there here my prediction they stop medical services for all unvaccinated even though they tax payers and force vaccinations if you want any coverage doctors will be forced to administer medical treatment to un consenting patients or lose their medical license vibes anyone all places of businesses will be forced to comply with sweeping vax passports no shirt no shoes no vax no food want to be employed eligible for employment eligible for welfare ei disability cpp etc need the vax will introduce a digital currency and banks will adopt it this gives the power to the government to cancel a person finances on command social score will be amalgamated with credit score insurability and social history so your ability to get a mortgage loan and life car home etc insurance rates will be dictated by medical history and your facebook memes and we be on the variant and lockdown by next christmas cause it still wo fucking work

same here and now climate change is a leftism thing apparently
no i totally agree it may come down to a hot air balloon dilemma where humanity must decide who needs to jump to make the balloon light enough to continue flying there will likely be both suicides and murders relating to climate change also i not proposing anything but it certainly is viable to have fewer children people who think having half a dozen children is acceptable are going to need to wake up to reality
we should absolutely see supply chain issues and climate change in terms of resource allocation rather than political cludgels absolutely i read a bit about the bronze age collapse but yeah we are all interconnected so systematic failure across many of those connections will mean that everyone is negatively affected not to sound like a doomer or anything but i just saw the video on mit predicting the collapse of civilization by and yeah it not pretty basically they ran simulations in the based on population available resources pollution industrial output and technological improvement our current path follows the business as usual model they predicted and that model ends in catastrophe it is extremely worrisome it especially worrisome that most of the people in power in the us wo be alive to see the consequences of their poor decisions and it the younger generations who will have to shoulder all that burden when they have virtually no say in avoiding the catastrophe they have to deal with
side note is that hillbrooks uniform is actually designed and agreed on by a committee of students and it only called climate change because global warming no longer fits the narrative the greenies tried to push

natural debate do forests grow better with our help or natural debate do forests grow better with our help or without this article is another long one so i recommend a full read through as the following paragraphs are just some key points i personally got out of the article and what i think serves as a decent summary of it nations around the world are pledging to plant billions of trees to grow new forests but a new study shows that the potential for natural forest regrowth to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and fight climate change is far greater than has previously been estimated cook patton new study published in nature and co authored by researchers from academic and environmental organizations says estimates of the rate of carbon accumulation by natural forest regrowth endorsed last year by the un intergovernmental panel on climate change are on average percent too low a figures that rises to percent for tropical forests the study is the most detailed attempt yet to map where forests could grow back naturally and to assess the potential of those forests to accumulate carbon we looked at almost measurements of carbon uptake from regrowing forests measured in around studies around the world cook patton told yale environment another study published this year found that such recovery was widespread and rapid even in an epicenter of deforestation such as the amazon when yunxia wang of the university of leeds in england analyzed recently released brazilian data from the amazon she found that percent of the forest being burned by ranchers to create new cattle pasture is not pristine forest as widely assumed but is actually recent regrowth the forest had been cleared converted to cattle pasture and then abandoned whereupon the forest returned so fast that it was typically only six years before it was cleared again such was the confusion caused by this rapid forest turnover that regular land use assessments frequently wrongly categorized this new growth as degraded old growth forest much the same has been happening in europe where forest cover is now up to percent often from naturally recolonizing farmland rather than planting italy for instance has grown its forest cover by a million acres in the former communist nations of central europe percent of farmland in the carpathian mountains was abandoned in the much of it reclaimed by the region famed beech forests across russia an area of former farmland about twice the size of spain has been recolonized by forests irina kurganova of the russian academy of sciences calls this retreat of the plow the most widespread and abrupt land use change in the century in the northern hemisphere ping eco
me too buddy there a reason why the russian bots attack baerbock so strongly if we really care about climate change they the only option there a lot of talk about european sovereignty by parties aligned with the epp but the truth is if you really want a europe completely independent from foreign influence including from america there has to be energy independence as well green energy is the only way forward
you might be right that climate change is connected with the economical growth in football but if we were to jump about talking from economical growth in football to how to stop climate change that seems like a drastic change in subject especially given the subreddit we in i think you inferring too much from what i wrote i simply point out that it a sudden change in subject even if you were right
ens when you only have two parties you do have anyone who is fiscally conservative and socially liberal and vise versa its more conservatives think rationally and liberals decided off emotions for example liberals think we must limit our production of oil by and another percent each year after that because climate change after the conservatives note half of prod is down the city is losing money and debt will triple
climate change made the northern hemisphere outrageously hot and dry fires that would have been small or easily controlled in the past have raged freely because the new climate is bringing in weather that helps fire spread lots of sun wind hot temperatures to dry out vegetation we did this
because we are in the fuck around stage of climate change anymore and the money launderers and pyramid scheme hacks that use nfts do give a shit if i buy a fucking charizard and then transfer it to my friend i do have to go clear cut a small forest to do so just admit you do care if we all live in a mad max society if it means you get to live a little richer and move on
i have to agree that the failure of the german revolution was probably the biggest setback to the century socialist movement not only did it halt the spread of the revolution into the heart of the imperialist core it also doomed the soviet union into having to take a militaristic seige mindset just to survive a mindset that they never recovered from and that ultimately doomed them relatedly the collapse of the soviet union is probably a strong second i not the biggest fan of what the soviet union became but the failure of the original revolution was a harsh blow while the ussr existed there was at least a debate on the merit of socialism afterwards the refrain of there is no alternative was bashed into the public consciousness with a mallet and now it overshadows all conversations on how we organize our society ca even talk about health care or climate change without socialism failed being used to shut down any attempts at reform the western interventions and atrocities against leftist movements in the developing world are definitely bad but had the german revolution succeeded they might never have happened
i sold home insurance for them for years they actually tracked rebuild cost every year however your rebuild cost bill only actually changes under two circumstances at renewal you get a notification of the new rebuild cost in the paperwork days before if you make a policy change that involves you recalculating coverages or updating home characteristics a great way to understand rebuild replacement costs is to ignore sales prices and think of the extreme examples i once sold a policy for a very basic square foot home in san francisco the member paid in excess of for the home but the rebuild calculated less than half of that they threw a fit until i explained if your house were to burn down tomorrow it would not cost to actually repair that sales price has school districts desirability job market public transport climate etc all baked into it but at the end of the day it still only a square foot house sure ca permitting and labor would be higher than most other states but certainly not to justify running up the rebuild cost more than the opposite applies home insurance for century old homes in rural areas often times has very high rebuild costs the purchase price might not be that high especially if it in a not as desirable area but older homes rarely use modern cheap construction techniques and often require specialized labor and materials to match edit typo

no logo that the one i semi read i not trolling just lazily asking from my memory she done quite a lot of left wing and climate change stuff still not trolling just weak memory
the author is right and also wrong yes running down the mainstream media helps to convince people that evidence research etc are less important than opinion pieces which reinforce your own biases this helps to drive the anti science nutcases who reject climate change and the gun fanatics who are convinced that many of the mass shootings across the usa are just false flag operations intended to impose gun control and a raft of other conspiracy theories the difficulty is that mainstream media has increasingly been consolidated under fewer and fewer owners so that currently of msm radio tv movies newspapers magazines are owned by only corporations of which are controlled by the same family that is providing the range of views needed by a healthy democracy instead it maintains a primarily corporate focus on articles and production focused on the bottom line and profitability at the expense of originality objectivity and journalistic integrity hence msm very rarely reports on anything that shows the usa in a bad light it regularly runs nationalistic puff pieces showing usa and rarely covers the way that corporate and personal greed is making wealth inequality much worse while also destroying any chance of a real democracy driven by an informed citizenry us msm were a primary enabler of the iraq war even when the evidence was overwhelming that bush amp cheney justifications for that invasion were fabricated they have rarely ever called for america leaders to be held accountable for their many war crimes they have rarely ever criticized the us policy of imperialism nor its means of implementing those policies by brute force so yes attacks on the media are helping drive the anti science movement of ignorance and complacency but media consolidation and a corporate media focus is the cause of so much of the distrust behind those attacks if those corporate media giants were broken up into separate and competing companies and tighter controls placed upon further consolidation real news might again flourish and trust in media might start to return
yeah give away not so much to people directly but on addressing fundamental structural issues such as infrastructure social work education disability funding social safety nets i can give you an example in my country i work for a funding scheme which allows participant funds to be allocated to services such as occupational therapy physio therapy etc these funds can increase the participants capacity to function in society acquire work and repay the contribution to the economy i seen this play out in real life raise the federal minimum wage too the argument of inflation concerns is utter bullshit considering how long it has been since a minimum wage rise the rise should be more closely indexed to inflation in order to maintain standards of living we are talking about an extremely small proportion of money in the economy there are flow on benefits too such as increased business and consumer participation money will actually be going to businesses rather than sucked up by basic cost of living elements such as rent it erroneous to only look at the direct cost of this and see it as a negative these investments are actually repaid over time just look up case studies on these areas energy taxes change the climate because they modify the competitive environment of industry and their profit motivation to innovate it a bad faith argument to basically assume that this would be done in isolation it would form part of the mitigation of climate change we should radically be changing industries now not because they are useful they are but because the earlier we begin this process properly the smoother and less disruptive the transition will be a price on carbon imo is actually pro capitalist because it occurs real costs to society in the long term which accrue a debt reflecting these costs more accurately is better business
so this was a really good and persuasive piece of rhetoric until you brought up god i assuming that you want to in good faith convince him to accept climate change thereby helping the cause to fight it and you were doing a really good job until you brought up god by doing that you shifting the argument from a rational argument about one of the most fundamental threats to continued human existence to something which seems to be a deeply held belief that he has something which is within the grand scheme of things irrelevant it does matter whether he believes in god or not and by introducing it to the argument you make it likely that any climate denial that he has is just reinforced making him even less likely to believe in climate change in the future
we do use carbon taxes to make people better off financially then that class warfare not green politics the climate change transition has to be financially sustainable for people further destroying peoples personal finances does help change their spending in any useful way
i think it largely statistics most people who oppose anthropogenic climate change theories are americans and most americans are christians i like to note that chrome spell check does not recognize anthropogenic i lead to conjecture that my web browser is a christian

you wrong about being too early into climate change for solid data there literally decades of evidence data from various agencies and sources have been collected since your assertion that the droughts today are no worse than any since settlement is also false reconstruction of the last years of seasonal rainfall patterns have shown the current drought to be unprecedented bushfires increased by cent between and in australia so i do know why you would state that there less bushfires now crop yields in australia increased enormously due to farming practices improving but have pretty much plateaued since the because of reduced rainfall so there you have it i done as you suggested and researched all those points and they very easily refuted
there are abundant reputable publications in many fields of study for decades which corroborate indisputably the failure of dark matter simply a meaningless placeholder to misdirect efforts to acknowledge plasma cosmology and the incredibly powerful effect of the sun on our planet climate change for example has been largely misattributed to human activity because the data used by all models excludes the majority of energy from the sun when all the data is considered human activity is negligible although the new solar forcing data has been available now for some time no publication has used it on their models so far however this is going to change in the next few years we are at the tail end of an interglacial warm period the earth future is cold as it has been for the majority of human experience
build a bunker is a metaphor you humorless windbag accelerating high carbon economic growth in the hopes that it will stimulate innovations that miraculously solve the problem is like accelerating your car towards the cliff because if you go fast enough you achieve lift and fly away the only thing stupider than what you pretend is the republican stance on climate change is the actual stance namely that the cliff is a chinese hoax leaving aside the personal attacks sure referencing the permian triassic extinction event is literally the most ignorant thing someone could do haha get a load of this moron there no iridium layer or confirmable impact crater associated with that extinction like there is the k t event and the extinction pattern is completely different it makes much more sense to attribute the extinction to the vast flood vulcanism we know happened in the siberian traps releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide leading to methane releases anoxia hydrogen sulfide poisoning and various other really really bad things that make just a million megaton explosion seem comparatively survivable in conclusion ffs i just came here to laugh at some overzealous dumbass on tumblr and now i trading essays with someone who throws around the word identitarian to the point it loses all meaning i hate myself for even engaging with you goodnight
from what i know there is a pretty strong correlation on climate change expertise and human based climate change acceptance like around of expert scientists do believe in it this is not simply argument from popularity or an argument from authority their expertise is what should make us believe them as we trust other fields of expertise in the same manner doctors mechanics etc and for some reason people seem to disrespect expert consensus but in terms of it being biblical it really depends on your exegesis i could see someone construing it as divine providence but idk probs not
it does seem to be at all imo i would say gen alpha if we even calling it that i do like the name is more like after everything started going politically wacky a lot of people think it about technology but it really about the type of issues faced by a generation and their reaction to those issues for post gen zers the struggle is that they are suffering the unintended political consequences of free market capitalism that is to say the rise of nationalism and the pursuit of national self sufficiency simultaneously however these post gen zers are absorbed by technology which presents this information to them on a grand scale meaning we are desensitized an issue that gen z has as well their lives will be filled with crises that seemingly never affect them until it becomes very bad pandemics climate change natural disasters etc gen z on the other hand our struggle has and always will be in our name we are seeing the beginning of the crises which will bring humanity to either relative utopia or dystopia and it why i do like the name gen alpha it suggests a rebirth whereas actually the next century or few will see huge infighting between states until some form of world unification perhaps through endeavours towards space we ca actually talk about generations without understanding their lives years old you can not speculate on what that generation will be about specifically but if we look at famous gen zers like greta we can clearly see the trend of hopeful nihilism forming in our psyche we want a better world but we understand that for it to change we need a recognition of crises
a slow one with climate change slowly but surely ramping up there going to be a point where the methane locked in polar ice is released once that happens it all over except the crying as a ghg methane insulates far better than the release will cause a positive feedback loop that will drive increasing temps well beyond what we currently see massive parts of the world will become uninhabitable due to heat famine flooding rising sea levels whatever the mass migration of climate refugees will dwarf any population movement we have ever seen as a species crop systems will collapse causing mass starvation world wide the quality of life in industrialized nations will fall slower than in other parts of the world but fall it will
do worry soon they no longer be able to deny man made climate change they be forced to switch to eco fascism immigrants have desroyed their own environments and now they are forced to flee like vermin and come here to destory ours
bernie considers global warming the most timely change to national security he opposed the manufacturing of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a drastic result on the climate bernie bot
because a labor win would have made a dent in worldwide climate change because they were going to magically force china india etc to stop
because you can usually tell someone political leanings when they exude a general sense of bitterness and aggression especially when it comes to anything to do with science they are typically either a religious fundamentalist or they skew extremely far right on the political spectrum usually both it not a huge leap of logic anitintellectualism and science denail are generally fascist traits so the fact that you attacked a children television presenter for not being a real scientist to discredit his opinion on climate change is a pretty obvious indicator of you political views because anyone who did have those views would have done it that what political leanings have to do with this
copy paste from my reply to a different comment on this post any trend analysis on hurricane data should be treated as highly suspect while there is enough data on the oceans to be able to assess that ssts have gone up in a statistically significant way we have not been able to take reliable measurements on hurricanes for a long enough time to make similar claims reliable data on hurricanes only goes back about years when people started using satellites to make measurements this is the major reason why modeling and climate attribution studies as opposed to trend analysis on direct observations are the most helpful tools for understanding how climate change impacts hurricanes they not claiming a trend they did a climate attribution study
why the constant labeling of those who accept the likelihood of human pressures contributing to climate change alarmists when many people who think this way do expect an apocalypse it is a polarizing and perjorative label that detract from meaningful debate
the republican party is the most dangerous criminal organization in history because of their climate change denial alone they will end up killing more people than hitler stalin and mao combined climate change will kill hundreds of millions of people at least think of how many people live in coastal cities that will be underwater think of all the famine that will be caused by droughts destroying crops
the german response to wwii has been one of the best lessons on how to deal with the fact that one nation has done horrible things it has always been like that though the upcoming cold war caused the western allies as well as the soviets to lose their interest in hunting down former nazis quite rapidly de nazification trials mostly turned into a farce as early as with many perpetrators being put on trial and aquitted away from public with some even being recruited to help shaping the new german state right away especially in west germany the newly elected federal government issued a law offering general amnesty to all former nazis who had been sentenced yet as early as with the western allies turning pending executions into lifetime prison sentences the same year out of respect for the new german constitution that outlawed the death penalty this allowed the generation of immediate perpetrators to hush up and bury the details of their crimes sure german students did learn about hitler the nazis and but never in such great detail they were to truly understand the full extend of what their parents and grandparents had allowed to happen or played an active part in cast a dirty great spotlight on it examine it in detail and put measures in place to ensure it never happens again it took until the social upheavals of the late and to change the political climate and allow for a more open confrontation of former nazis and the culture of silence they established the period of social democratic led federal and state governments throughout the into the also helped breaking up these structures but the way it dealt with today was widely established before the wehrmacht exhibition which was supposed to clean up the myth of the german army being mostly uninvolved with nazi crimes it a constant uphill battle to maintain this culture too btw there are far right politicians who would like to replace our culture of rememberance with a more patriotic approach they remain suspiciously silent on the details but their slogans usually involve stuff like time to end the guilt cult or for a germany worthy of pride so never take this for granted i just wish my own country could own up to its own horrible past well you have to make it own up as long as politicians can rake in votes through mindless nationalism they see no reason to change anything and more so than germany the us would need a culture of mutual understanding as in the end the descendants of perpetrators and victims alike form one society as many surviving holocaust victims left germany for understandable reasons this was as much of an issue we were able to work out our relationship with the people we caused great suffering to mostly from a distance you have to do that without tearing your country apart which to be fair is quite a daunting task as long as people are divided through race lines as long as americans are treated differently based on the color of their skin as long as any kind of honest debate is shaped mostly by party politics instead of mutual understanding i afraid you only be treading water instead of making progress
to make it we call is climate change that way if it gets hot or cold snows or does snow tornadoes and hurricanes or does tornado or hurricane we can blame it on climate change there but for the grace of climate change go
climate change is false because it snowing on the east coast it like saying the boat is sinking because your end just rose feet
one concept i have read in the other comments sorry if i missed it is if an issue has too much uncertainty in the future and that issue has no precedent whether in type of issue or scale that the past is not necessarily indicative of the future then can we think of an example at least on how humanity treated a similar problem with a similar nothing in history is like this event that seems unlikely we band together and deal with it in time for me when i think about the problem of climate change that the ozone layer problem that became a big issue in the i not double checking specific facts that are pertinent to this cmv sorry if i mess a fact up hopefully it not critical to my overall proposal all the major countries who have money to lose by finding more expensive ways to do fundamental things like refrigeration actually solved the problem and it took decades and pretty weak pacts called the montreal protocol it somehow worked in a complicated way i have to spend years of my finite life studying i do know how we deal with the more complex and complicated issue of climate change for example that requires such levels of working together across the globe and technology and economics beyond the ozone hole problem and recent news shows there may be some previously unknown chemicals that may still be affecting the ozone layer we have to address but i thought that way before the ozone hole problem and was proven wrong so that how the past can help support the argument that the continuous improvement of the past leads to hope to the future end of point but some implications i like anyone thoughts on if anything it helps me focus on what actually drives that past continuous improvement future success in all problems line that people wrongfully hold as gospel it not gospel we could all succumb to tribalism nationalism in an unhealthy way and not solve climate change for example it can likely only be solved by working together since these types of problems are by nature beyond one individual or group of individuals and historical examples of that are what prove that it possible even if i as an individual do nothing that gets to why people hold that line as gospel because it makes them feel better about not doing enough and that the scissors where rational thought is paper for the human brain but the concept i lay out here shows that irrational thought feels better than considering the rational alternative until it does per your home foreclosure example it does take people working together to solve issues that are easily solved by looking at the past because we need new ideas and mindsets i guilty of this irrational thought as well for example i do do enough for poverty though my career is tackling one small part of climate change cleaner energy but my own internal cost benefit analysis today is that i pay taxes and try to get a government just another group of people to solve the issues i have to choose not to spend years of my life learning about to address i do my bit with my particular learnings skills of being wealthy enough to not have to worry about day to day survival and try to get others to do their version of the same however they can and be happy when they do
well in my country cigarettes are mainly banned in public places expensive ca be advertised etc i support all laws which protect people like sugar taxes and sin taxes my opinion is that it makes companies make their products healthier however gun crimes are instant shocking and importantly do happen by one person hurting themselves but also others sometimes such as in orlando people in the space of minutes climate change and smoking kill even more but do have the shock factor however the state must do what it can to protect and help its people guns sugar climate change smoking we should make laws based on scientific evidence rather than political ideology
climate change or nuclear war it would be north korea or iran to start it in my opinion
no idea why a year old would be denying climate change that just for the boomers who will die before it gets really bad and the ultra rich fossil fuel executives who already have underground bunker complexes to retreat to i sure hope the fleeting glory of dunking on the libtards is a comforting thought to return to when the coastlines disappear into the sea and your country collapses into anarchy when there not enough food left for everyone
if you intend to make the world better raise a person who will make the world better and who will in turn raise a person who will make the world better good intentions it not factoring in that the children you create are individuals with their own thoughts and feelings you can do your best to raise your child in what you deem is better and they could end up as a rapist murderer or drug addict most likely they just end up as average it like all those people that assume their hypothetical child is going to grow up to cure cancer or solve climate change maybe someone somewhere will accomplish that one day but do pin all your hopes and dreams on your so you can live vicariously through them
climate change advocates just cus it snowing and cold right now does mean climate change is real also climate change advocates after any bad weather related event this is clear evidence that we are spending enough tax money on preventing climate change the hypocracy is real
percent believe they are science illiterate nearly percent think the science of global warming is unclear both of these sound scary but i suggest they not so much the first number being optimistic contains all those who do know what they do know too there a whole lot of science where i call myself basically illiterate that does mean that if it suddenly becomes relevant i not going to try to understand it it means that as long as i can make a phone call on my phone the fact that i not sure how it works does much matter to me and the for climate change say it unclear i can kind of understand that was global warming supposed to cause worse winters was it more tropical storms or worse tropical storms how fast were the ice caps supposed to melt unclear is the same as not happening and as a layperson i actually agree that while there widespread consensus that climate change is happening what it going to do exactly remains pretty unclear
please correct me if i wrong but i read from scientists that recognize climate change that the total amount the seas will rise is a bit misleading the water does raise uniformly on our planet i think it had to do with magnetic forces for instance if we melt a certain portion of the antarctic ice cap and the sea level will raise meter that is meter worldwide it could be meters in some places and cm in another part of the world some places will be harder hit than others while others that are at or slightly above sea level will actually not be affected that much ps i feel like i need to affirm that i recognize climate change and the need to do something about it also that it might be too late
of course they did like those actions here are the reasons why increased tariffs benefit only benefit the government if anybody exporters see decreased demand because they have to offset the importation cost to consumers pulling out of climate agreements trump receives campaign donations from oil gas and he wants to pander to the antiintellectual crowd so of course this was financially and politically motivated climate change is happening as a result of fossil fuel combustion and anybody who does believe that is eating up propaganda from the oil gas industry building a border wall a symbolically negative gesture that retraces from the original concept of america being a melting pot that accepted people from all walks of life maybe this goes hand in hand with his shithole countries comments allowing fewer immigrants highlights my previous point quite well and it a shame to see the downturn in opportunity for international citizens looking to move to the us pulling out of the iran deal huge fucking mistake we had an arrangement that we would audit their nuclear programs to ensure they were being used to research and manufacture wmds i have no idea how this could be construed as a positive once again huge fucking mistake us negotiations with nk in the context of its nuclear capabilities are probably the most productive of these issues as evidenced by the approval the only problem is they did do jack shit in the long run
it earth day and folks with concerns about the planet thought this would be a great opportunity to follow up on the women march with another btw at the marches there were tons of signs about the environment climate change and science denial in short there is a lot of overlap right now with science and environmentalism
i think i have the largest bucket of sand in the world to throw my head into and hope for the best whilst not actually achieving anything in the meantime my actual old brmcforum username was taken on here hence the frustriation amp adding a dammit on the end escapism is definitely my go to i never used to be this way until i found a world that needed exploring this does sit well alongside climate change but that a work in progress without travel i definitely go crazy so it about exploring it within reasonable carbon limits one perk of the lockdowns has been the amount of time large amounts of people have had to just think be quiet and consider and out of that comes a new mindset and balance of what important to them and what bullshit i do have a ton more questions for you but i figure you sick of the online life i managed to wean myself away from social media pretty effectively now never thought that happen but if you are in the mood for answering what thoughts do you get whenever you gig in a historic venue they are just buildings stages after all but does the weight of history have any affect bearing on you amp the performance all my other q will wait until we finally meet again if we able to get close enough i suspect hugs will be off limits these days physical connections are remarkable
god damned climate change
well then do fire people or keep them from graduating college because they used the term climate change in a report or town hall meeting also do deny there is a ban on using the term climate change when there is tons of proof to the contrary
and people will probably be happier in the long run if they embrace the idea that everyone should be entitled to a base standard of living that can be easily enabled by modern surplus sorry humans do work that way i completely agree though btw there is not too much difference with offering jobs at a living wage and a basic income the idea just needs some slight adjustments why not accept that getting to a useful job guarantee is going to be difficult enough ensuring as it must that everybody is doing something they enjoy and that others see as valuable as well as informing the general public constantly of that value in each local area broadening the concept of what work is and means is the main challenge in fact in some countries it may be impossible until unemployment gets to depression levels probably beyond that towards societal breakdown humans like to push things to the very edge before making a course alteration as we seeing with the response to climate change ultimately big people tend to be interested in abolishing a quite narrow idea of work as a matter of basic philosophy it a core value to them they are a very small minority of people that like the idea of not having to do anything for a living and being free even though that freedom is really extended to those that will have to continue to work to keep the lights on and who would have to pay a much higher tax rate for the privilege
china and india emit waaay less per capita china is the biggest investor in green energy stop saying asia is the biggest problem for climate change they are on board the us is no longer
well if you were to ignore the fact that it is not an opinion and just false info climate change denial would still not meet the bar for being unpopular as there are enough climate change deniers that belief in the credibility of climate change does make up an overwhelming majority thus it would just be controversial not unpopular
the entire point of carbon tax is to fight emissions climate change it not to be and endless source of revenue for the government to spend at will
climate change feedback loops are starting this has been theorized for a while now and it finally here unless we drastically reduce fossil fuel reliance in the next five years we basically fucked on the bright side this is the beginning of the solar pv era
sir or madam everyone knows that rain and water will flow to a point of lowest elevation engineers and architects know this there are areas called year year and year flood zones a fluke flood still has a chance of happening and people smarter than you or i studied and calculated the chances of this happening i hope that you understand that a fluke flood definitely has been affected by climate change and that those old calculations will need to be updated because of climate change
draws a weird conclusion from disillusionment with social media politics to suddenly it because i hyper privileged from a social media site made for not working surely you privileged enough to not be concerned about issues such as the aca covering pre existing conditions abortion rights daca climate change etc why would you vote if you were genuinely impacted by these things i drawing a conclusion based on inductive reasoning i not calling you hyper privileged like you said unless you consider hyper privileged to be anyone in even the lower middle class pretty sure reddit demographics skew around middle class completely true and just as annoying and cringey though i found it much easier to not suscept myself to wherever these memes are posted it basically depends on which platform you on for example if you on twitter memes might lead you to believe the world is ready for some huge socialist revolution while the political reality of the world is nowhere near that i agree but am confused how you can be surprised that political apathy is a side effect of this i not surprised at all however i think political apathy does just come from disillusionment over memes there are people who ca afford to not care i just saying you probably not one of those people i not calling you a millionaire or anything i saying that you can probably afford to be apathetic it not an attack or anything but i apologize if i came off that way
when the science did back up the cooling and warming they changed it to climate change the ipcc was founded in guess what the cc part stands for
less evil but they big fans of neo liberal economic policies favoring profits over people sending jobs overseas to exploit world workers at wage slaves maximizing profit at all costs even if it means climate change etc
there is considerable evidence for climate change climate change has become the accepted position of a majority of scientists largely because of the overwhelming data not in spite of it and not for lack of those trying to debunk it no more than there ever was that nasa propaganda page cites sources none which provide any measurable data whatsoever it less here proof than it is here what everyone else is saying dress it up with a pretty website on a taxpayer funded web server and people like you eat it up without question the link i provided which breaks out results by locale placement quality and standards compliance is far more demonstrative it actual data that last paragraph is a conspiracy theory what does this have to do with ted cruz again
the changing climate from where i come from it always good to have a different change in weather i do get much cold weather in florida where i from so it fun
it because there are claims that many will die as a consequence to climate change so denying would make you complicit it an accurate comparison but most people wo get it when they read it
the priority setting in my country is hilarious germans like to see themself as a morally fulfilled people who got over all those century ideas of geopolitics and nationalism still most people do get that they ca live in their dream world when everyone around them things in different spheres germany is like this autistic kid that ca comprehend actual circumstances but that is what you get when you totally abandon security politics a recent poll showed that climate change is still the most important problem for germans to deal with yes it is obviously important but how do you want to deal with it when the economy lies in shades multilateralism is dead and the political system is totally destroyed
climate change is not gon na be fun
well first we can have farmers and ranchers and still drastically change the way we produce food for instance silvopasturing is where you graze animals in wooded areas which helps provide shade and heat resistance but as we look at what climate change is doing we are definitely going to have to change our diets in some big ways the un recommends that countries of the world really start implementing more insect farming we should probably also begin making mushrooms much more integral parts of our diets we will also have to drastically lower our meat dependency though feeding cows small amounts of seaweed has been shown to reduce their methane emissions by a considerable amount
the us has never been invaded by land sea or air pearl harbor albeit the invasion was repelled but it was an invasion nonetheless likely wo be in the foreseeable future maybe maybe not its always best to prepare for the worst and hope you wrong no nation including china has the means motive or manpower to do so at present you right but china is slowly infiltrating the canadian news world huawei meng likely to the ends of having a sympathetic nation that shares a continent with the us with the goal of staging a land invasion and that article was from radio silence since in my opinion an attack on the mainland us is imminent within the next years or sooner china has a massive middle class bigger than the entire us population that wo support a military invasion that would immediately make the world turn against them the world has turned against china regarding their systematic genocide of muslims and the chinese middle class supports the ccp doing such things the people are sympathetic to communist party regardless of where it leads them china does have the ability to project force outside their region not asia south china sea controversy heats up as manmade islands are almost complete news they on the verge of being able to annex taiwan and then south korea which houses a over us troops and likely are eyeing japan afterwards do you think there are more important things to fear than invasion such as climate change or the massive wealth disparity in the us both can be solved by the government simply not meddling in the free market
i think lots of things are good or bad to do for example cheating on your partner is wrong but i do think it should be a crime leaving the heating on when you are home contributes to climate change but i do think it should be illegal
the un is the biggest joke maybe lets let the dinosaur loose in the exon offices and watch some justice happen other than that and until they ready to actually put the blame on those who actually still profit from climate change the un is a joke
answer yes it is a scare tactic the ipcc issued a report found here basically unless changes are made the earth may warm by f above pre industrial climate somewhere between and it is important to remember this includes the current increase over pre industrial climate of somewhere in the range of c to c in other words people are freaking out over a c to c temperature increase within to years or rather they did read the report yes this is serious and should be taken seriously but no humanity is going to die realistic projections of climate change is tough as much because people who think scare tactics are valid as people who dismiss climate change entirely reading the report directly is hard it more understandable than most folks think i would highly recommend it so far every projection that humanity will die from x have been wrong with track record this is dismissive of threats just speaking to the historical accuracy of scare tactics take concerns seriously but do let other people try to scare you into agreeing read the reports and view accordingly
more is collected than given back completely false this is publicly available en environment climate change services climate change pricing pollution how it will work putting price on carbon if you in a province covered by the federal carbon tax it is being operated revenue neutrally and the government has documentation and reporting to show it please stop spreading misinformation
what republicans are blocking everything with their damn filibuster you ca even get ten republicans to agree to pass voting rights guarantees or climate change or affordable childcare they pushing their insane abortion bounties blocking childcare and pre it fucking gross yes some democrats like manchin are helping republicans obstruct in a senate one coal baron democrat from a republican state can cause a lot of damage still bigger problem republicans as an entire mob cult are blocking all climate change like hell because i guess they want to burn to death
hat tip to p police ask enbridge to pay which broke this story back in april if you want a world where we do depend on foreign oil companies to pay off our cops to shoot americans with rubber bullets for engaging in climate change rubber bullet protest i recommend that you give congress a the clean electricity standard in the reconciliation bill is a first step towards full decarbonization
also the hillary part was quite accurate meh on the climate change a lot of people believe but distrust the policy decisions pushed in its name also nyt
it was times donald called climate change a hoax who gives a fuck if he attributed it to mickey mouse god or his daughter that is an absurd position to hold hardly hyperbole
another thing is that a lot of new zealanders do beleive in climate change people think that everyone in nz are all progressive and leaders of our society but they really are in pretty much the same boat as the us
but what would be the point just right now it feel good article for people like you and me who already are on board so we can pat our own shoulder and laugh at how stupid trump is even if it stopped being funny long time ago while for people who do believe in human made climate change for some crazy reasons besides financial interests it does do anything article like this are just making the bubbles around us thicker i feel like people are really getting angry at me and try to insult me because i made more philosophical remark on how science in my opinion works
yeah public transit would literally be the best option we have to fight climate change but no musk hates it so let not work on that
its not a fact its more of an opinion from you i do nt know how you expect the police of all people to single handedly solve the mental health crisis also i do nt see how them doing their jobs more than they already have been would help stop violent crime unless some sort of overhaul in financial care is established for people to be able to properly support themselves or some of the current issues in the world pandemic climate change braindead government poverty increased corporate control etc are solved so people no longer have to resort to violent crime to vent their anger with a world that does nt give a shit about them weed has nothing to do with the issues you re raising its a corrupt system that leaves people in the dirt and forces them to resort to violence in order to feel noticed and feel like they can do something that is in their own control
radiohead progress from one album to another is amazing probably comparable only to the beatles adjusted for their times and climate i do really like the king of limbs and found only a track or two from in rainbows great but it still amazes me how much they managed to change during their career and how each of their albums sounds like separate entities that could have been very well recorded by different bands
it the lack of the concept of a better future the past generations saw new inventions and continues progress in pretty much all fields continuously improving quality of life in all aspects that is not a very prevalent thought these days a wast majority of young people and under believes we are fucking our self over and beyond with climate change and pollution ie the future is fucking darkness and both the ability and will to do something or anything with it seems non existent of course that makes people depressed
the danger of climate alarmism is that we all end up living in fear of an unlikely scenario unlikely we literally on the path and doing absolutely nothing to correct it this is exactly the problem this critique is addressing kurz vid obfuscates the real effects of climate change and what is being done to address it hint nothing
you do think climate change is a thing
ok but from a practical perspective how does this change the discussion perhaps the houses flooded by dam releases are less likely to flood under past conditions will that continue to be true in the future who can tell elevating the houses during rebuilding might still be prudent climate change and its effects on weather patterns are hard to predict with certainty but signs point to increased chances of storms on this scale in many regions best wishes to your friend in this difficult time
we know what disinfo causes harm the ones that cause the most harm free markets and climate change denial are even talked about by the anti free speech crowd just shows how much their stance is based on a gut reaction and not on thinking things through furthermore there are plenty of ways to fight disinfo just not with censorship censorship is actually one of the least effective ways of doing that chomsky and others have covered this point before
they got a million subsidy years ago and i not sure if lower electricity prices are a payment of course million in carbon credits are another issue when there is no cost in the allocation but then we would have to look at fisheries to forestry to farming then
it a partial admission of the truth which makes for the perfect piece of propaganda the planet is fast approaching the catastrophic global temperatures that countries have promised to avoid every fraction of a degree beyond that will wreak havoc on the livelihoods of millions of people potentially destabilize economies and political systems and dramatically reshape water access and ecosystems as we know them the end is near repent the sky is falling do look up step think about how your skillset and interests can contribute to climate action everyone is special even you step identify your target freeze your target thanks saul alinsky step bring climate change discourse offline annoy your friends family and coworkers profit organizational behavior expert thomas bateman and climate scientist michael mann have written about the importance of believing in one powers or self efficacy which can make you more likely to persevere rebound from setbacks and perform at high levels mann i think i heard that name before
the moonshot will come from inflation not climate change initiatives
i try to use this same logic when arguing about climate change like even if we not the one causing it and it just some natural cycle or whatever what so wrong about improving our environment water air quality etc what so bad about laws that would literally make our planet a healthier place to live the response to that question is never founded in logic
it like trying to deny climate change i remember abbott and turnbull saying that bs too
prageru the same outlet that says climate change is a hoax the democrats are the real confederates and parties never changes even though there are many people flying confederate flags in the trump rallies
true this anti intellectualism that trump ideology is promoting is honestly so dangerous right now is the exact time period where humanity slips from becoming a utopia to becoming an overpolluted mess like in the movie idiocracy right now is when all of those dystopian sci fi movies are becoming true and all because of some uneducated trump voters vehemently maintaining their ignorance and denial of climate change so they can justify why they lost their jobs
i think you looking at the edition the edition which advocated self deporting over ten million people a constitutional amendment against gay marriage feigned ignorance of whether climate change was human caused and advocated a similar tax bill to the one passed under trump was anything but moderate
climate change is massive bummer and a sad way to go but war used to be ever present and a big part of most communities throughout history imagine what collapse meant for tribes of yesteryear some folks coming over to pillage and plunder now that what i call anthropogenic destruction
humans are causing climate change due to excessive fossil fuel usage the issue has always been that the implications of these facts often seem to revolve around implementing socialism or attacking christianity
using a real person and lying about their accomplishments is the definition of defamation i can see the merit behind the suit to a degree but at the same time the show did present the false claim as an absolute fact it was simply something a character on the show said that is why could a character on a show simply be wrong about something if there a character who a conspiracy nut and claims that the earth is flat climate change is real and bill nye is working for the deep state does bill nye have a defamation case
why are you bringing up all that other stuff unless of course you want to conflate them so as to delegitimize a point of view his positions on climate change do not usually get criticized just his years spent at bp working in alternate energy solutions
do you really feel that of climate scientists have conspired to create climate change no where did you get that impression
besides proliferation risks the reason nuclear has been widely adopted is just a matter of costs no one can build reactors that can produce electricity at competitive lcoes in most free markets which means that every new reactor project requires massive subsidisation solar and wind are market competitive so people will still build them even without subsidies or carbon taxes here a science article pii see also the landmark industry img en this is the foreword nuclear power was born in a sea of euphoria out of a collective american guilt over dropping the atomic bomb and for at least two decades it was the clean alternative to coal that was going to meet all of our energy needs forever the three mile island meltdown in ended the euphoria but the dream continued and it still goes on without much regard to contrary facts the opponents of nuclear power have shown a similar disregard for changing facts they largely ignored the fact that many well meaning people viewed local air pollution and climate change more of a danger than nuclear in those years shutting down a nuclear plant did mean increased emissions of local pollutants and green house gases the debate about nuclear power was similar to talking about a religion it was seldom grounded in all the relevant each side had a religious belief in their point of view boosted by whatever ad hoc facts supported their view because of that history this world nuclear industry status report is perhaps the most decisive document in the history of nuclear power the report makes clear in telling detail that the debate is over nuclear power has been eclipsed by the sun and the wind these renewable free fuel sources are no longer a dream or a projection they are a reality that are replacing nuclear as the preferred choice for new power plants worldwide it no longer matters whether your greatest concern is nuclear power or climate change the answer is the same the modern day edisons have learned to harness economically the everlasting sources of energy delivered to earth by mother nature free of charge the value of this report is that this conclusion no longer relies on hope or opinion but is what is actually happening in country after country the facts are the same nuclear power is far from dead but it is in decline and renewable energy is growing by leaps and bounds the entire report is must be read so that the facts of nuclear decline in the germany japan and france indeed just about every really sinks in it is more than symbolic that the japanese government has formally accepted the death of its breeder reactor which was the original holy grail of nuclear power most revealing is the fact that nowhere in the world where there is a competitive market for electricity has even one single nuclear power plant been initiated only where the government or the consumer takes the risks of cost overruns and delays is nuclear power even being considered the most decisive part of this report is the final nuclear power vs renewable energy development it reveals that since worldwide renewable energy has produced four times as many new kilowatt hours of electricity than nuclear power maybe the revolution has not been televised but it is well underway renewable energy is a lower cost and cleaner safer alternative to fossil fuels than nuclear power the world no longer needs to build nuclear power plants to avoid climate change and certainly not to save money if you have any doubt about that fact please read the world nuclear industry status report
poors are ruining the planet with cheap and affordable personal transportation according to the woke climate agenda well they kind of are even if you ignore the whole climate change thing air pollution sucks and cities full of cars are not nice places to be as a pedestrian maybe your ideal city is a car oriented american style city with hour commutes for everyone but mine is more like amsterdam personally if you aucklanders want to turn your city into los go ahead but can we turn christchurch into the amsterdam of the south instead please it already pretty flat decent cycling infrastructure central city rebuild can be used to promote pedestrian oriented development etc
the media is largely owned by billionaires and is not far left at all all but one major canadian newspaper for example endorsed the conservatives in the recent election climate change coverage is balanced by bs from fossil fuel paid quacks and frauds not far left not even left nor centre but what suits the monied classes the reason they dump on trump is because he is or could be depending on what he says from one day to the next actually antiestablishment if so he a huge threat to a lot of vested interests in addition trump gets massive coverage and what media does like that
no that millenials are just looking for free stuff and on the other side there just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college free healthcare that what we done has gone far enough and that we just need to you know go as far as you know scandinavia whatever that means and half the people do know what that means but it something that they deeply feel not the corruption citizens united climate change her war hawkishness she always has to point the finger and blame others instead of looking at her own choices
these are nonwhite country its ok for them to do it and what so u do nt believe climate change
your article about the boreal forests contains misleading data about the net sink of the boreal forests specifically it has been going consistently down report is that it fluctuates article stipulates it was a year net sink as recently as and basically drops like a stone switching over in to a point of no return but that is incorrect net emissions removals from the lulucf sector have fluctuated over recent years switching from a net source of mt in to a net sink of mt in and subsequently back to a net source of mt in fluctuations are driven mainly by variations in emissions from hwp and removals from forest land that are closely tied to harvest en environment climate change services climate change greenhouse gas emissions sources sinks executive
if you think that collective action is permissible feel free to elaborate on what in your opinion is the least harmful avenues to deal with the problem for example would a climate change defense complex that is focused on the problem like the military industrial complex is on war be the preferred model simple carbon tax cap and trade whatever i not going to debate you but part of the problem is that climate change can mean a lot of things with varying degrees of seriousness and urgency obviously these considerations would have to go into determining the appropriate response pragmatically i do think a tax is the way to go it will hurt the poor and encourages government corruption the government can always find a way to support a tax if we take your asteroid example as indicative of how serious a response should then banning the sale of fossil fuels would probably be since peron x burning fuels would directly kill person if the seriousness is less urgent than an asteroid hitting the earth in a few then there are plenty of free market solutions that do require coersion
idk there are things we can do about it but all would require drastic changes and people with a lot of money are invested in the things which contribute most to climate change we can change our energy usage we can progress more heavily towards electric vehicles we can do more research into lab grown meat instead of farming there are a lot of things we can do to help stop the rapid acceleration of anthropogenic climate change but all of it would require a massive overhaul of politics
vegetarians have been causing murder and climate change for decades now switch over to the environmental friendly lifestyle return to your roots eat dirt
well consider this obama obama actually got re elected last time non sequitur the two are not comparable as obama was actually qualified to be president the suicidal tendencies are very strong you not being rational here i understand you going to lose and badly it okay you get used to president clinton but as of today and especially with the uproar over billclintonisarapist there is no such uproar the uproar is about trump rapist tendencies i told its too late for them to replace her with another candidate too they do need to because she is going to win so hello president trump and good bye climate change regulations and agreements d you are delusional i bet you canadian that clinton will win the presidency time to put your money where your mouth is
this is gon na be a bit of a rant this movie has been what i been worrying about since i was a kid everyone told me i was wrong and that humans are slow walking to disaster the last two years in this pandemic told me that i completely right but it also weirdly gave me some comfort in the end if i at least try to stop the destruction i know that i at least gave it my all if we really are gon na slow walk off to great destruction at least i can prepare myself climate change kessler syndrome nuclear war pandemic famine are all very realistic and interconnecting issues that the world could face in the next century it just important that we look up and try to resist the urge to accept that they are inevitable the movie society may be representative of too many people on earth but that does mean humanity has to remain this stupid we can build a better more unified humanity we just need to embrace that rationalism and selflessness should be the basis for our society we have to keep in mind that every decision we have will effect those that will descend from us for eternity what world do we want to leave them will we even leave a world for them we a rational and intelligent species when we want to be if we stopped thinking for our own individual greed and bias for one moment then we could maybe build a glorious global community that could tackle these threats the most important part of this movie is that we collectively as a species get to decide the planet we live in we have technology that would make us gods compared to our ancestors the real question is how do we use it what type of beings do we want to be for our planet we can accomplish anything we set our mind to do we just need to actually focus on the important things
maybe because they experience societal problems boomers were sheltered from in their time climate crisis housing market crisis job market sucks wages been stagnant since the meanwhile inflation chugs along also mental health is becoming less taboo people are becoming more educated and thus you see it more and more trust me this is only the beginning if you hate millenials and zoomers complaining demanding change you in for a hell of a ride
climate change is a low priority but he does admit to some human connectivity he called it a hoax
the people in charge make money of you believing it is fake through lobbying fossil fuel is a big business they specifically pushed the us government to debate bills that had little chance of passing they are trying their damndest to not take responsibility for the shit they have wrought upon the world the government is full of people who do think climate change is a big issue most of the effective restrictions are targeted at large businesses and regulations for new constructions these are making more electric and efficient appliances increasing the amount of renewable energy in the grid and generally just making improves here and there of course that does cover all ecological problems like deforestation and the huge ocean pollution issues we are at now but they are linked probably the biggest consumer restriction would be if meat and air travel were restricted but that probably wo happen unless decent alternatives exist
yeah it a pretty serious thing i suggest reading farsighted by steven johnson to really understand the decision making behind climate change humans are just using the tools of their time to make forecasts making predictions about the future we been doing weather forecasts for centuries
i an engineer and i disagree with you the industrial revolution happened because of our change in worldview see reenchantment of the world and our access to a largely untouched resource base coal oil gas metals have you read any history of science or do you think the industrial revolution was part of some natural progression it was not even though i an engineer i refer to engineers as knowledgeable idiots engineers are fantastic at finding solutions to technical problems but they are largely ignorant about history sociology philosophy anthropology and economics engineers are poorly read and will turn to whatever seems good to them at the moment reading thomas friedman praising apple products talking about the success of technical achievements discussing technical solutions to climate change amp pollution engineers are also very hostile to criticism of technology and engineering
oh yeah i forgot about the climate change that will shut people up
the freakonomics guys have been writing quite a bit about geoengineering research see geoengineering here another scientists seek plan b for fighting cse in the new york times and one in the idea is that there are ways of cooling the earth that are possibly much cheaper and more effective than say convincing everyone to cut their carbon emissions but the climate change crowd has generally been railing against the idea because it goes against the narrative so much sure it basically treating the symptoms but if you can counteract the symptoms of your disease do you care if you sick
what is actually left in this bill billion to fight climate change largely through tax incentives for low emission sources of energy billion to provide universal prekindergarten to and year olds and to significantly reduce health care costs for working families earning up to a year billion to extend an expanded tax credit for parents through and to permanently allow parents to benefit from the child tax credit even if they do not earn enough money to have income tax liability billion to reduce health care premiums for people who are covered through the affordable care act to provide insurance for an additional four million people through medicaid and to offer hearing coverage through medicare billion to reduce a waiting list for in home care for seniors and disabled americans and to improve wages for home health care workers billion to build one million affordable housing units billion for immigration streamlining in part to reduce a backlog of nine million visas house democrats proposed provisions last month to address the legal immigration system including a plan to recapture hundreds of thousands of unused visas various administrations failed to use over several decades the investment outlined on thursday would also expand legal representation for migrants and streamline processing at the southwest border officials said mr biden has faced criticism from both republicans and democrats for his handling of migration to the border billion for worker training and higher education including increasing annual pell grants by offsetting that spending is an estimated trillion in revenue increases including a percent minimum tax on the reported profits of large corporations efforts to reduce profit shifting by multinational companies including a separate percent minimum tax on profits earned by companies abroad and tax penalties for companies that have their headquarters in global tax havens a percent tax on corporate stock buybacks increased enforcement for large corporations and the wealthy at the internal revenue service an additional percent tax on incomes exceeding million a year and another percent tax on incomes above million efforts to limit business losses for the very wealthy and to impose a percent medicare tax on certain people earning more than a year who did not previously pay that tax
this is why we have the democratic process people who run on climate positive agendas should make this known and once they get elected they need to stay on track and keep fighting the current progressive caucus is vocal sure but they do nt step up on key issues when its time that is every bit a problem with not only climate change but wages and healthcare the public needs to start electing people based off their positions on key issues zero comprimise
can you name for me the current gop plan for curbing carbon emissions and combating global climate change can you tell me the gop plan for universal healthcare do they even have a healthcare plan at all can you tell me what their immigration reform plan is how about their plan to deal with the student debt crisis the details of their infrastructure bill do they even have one of those their plan to stop iranian nuclear proliferation their plan to reform immigration their stance on the women equal rights act their stance on abortion rights on marijuana legalization on preventing voter suppression gerrymandering gay marriage see i a pragmatist these are the issues i care about i do vote for democrats because i like democrats i vote for them because they more closely align with my stances on these issues if at some point in the future there was a major political realignment and suddenly the reverse were to be true then i vote republican instead but as it is right now the republicans seem to me to be on the wrong side of too many things i care about and they are currently too insane to ever appeal to me so i told the kid instead of learning about politics learn about the issues you care about then compare the candidates amp parties to your stances on these issues this we can agree on but i do see how your original post made this point forgive me for not spelling it out for the stupid people
well if you a climate change denier perhaps you should have tried to insinuate that the free market is a solution before abandoning it after it does support your point that people will make rational decisions to solve the problem your counter argument is moving the goalposts to essentially that the problem does exist why you think i would engage with this i do know also you think laws and regulations are bad because nazism i honestly do know if you trolling you think the free market neoliberalism would prevent nazis and world atrocities you a perfect example of the cultist religious like belief in neoliberalism but no i do enjoy talking with crazy people let leave it there
reminds me of a comment that you have found your trigger second i think some doubt in the all pervasive narrative of progress must be triggered somehow a personal set back may have helped set the wheels in motion but it was mostly just that one day a few years ago i decided to study climate change in depth and then became aware of the scope of that problem from there it was a short journey to the general predicament of collapse i actually do think that collapse is obvious and a well based conclusion that collapse will occur must come from some understanding of history anthropology science and technology the seed of suspicion or doubt can come from much less of course just identifying one part of the standard narrative that does not makes sense can be enough for a start from collapse comments cnzmmt it understandable but watch out so that you do fall into despair
honestly if they want to come in and splash a whole bunch of cash about to get renewables even further along i can be upset yes it is mildly aggravating that to everyone but the historians it was britain green industrial revolution the catastrophic effects of climate change do outweigh a sense of bruised pride
seen it over the years a turning point was the jfk coup wwii opened the door as eisenhower warning us because by the we saw traitors like prescott bus profiting from selling and supporting the enemies of america and ghw bush was part of the jfk coup gw bush war being the longest in history as he was america version of putin reagan was senile and was another tool for big business clinton not good put many people in jail trump of course is a traitor and a head of a criminal organization plastic is awful and climate change is on it path of death lead in house paint water pipes and automobile exhaust addled brains for about years making people violent stolen and poisoned
being pro gun does mean being a piece of shit conservative i pro gun because of climate change and the mad max deathfuture
i sorry but i just do buy that i do deny climate change but i also do think its too late to do anything about it
omg the next thing you know tobacco will be spending huge wads of cash to lobby senators and members of congress without even caring what their politics are wow big tobacco that so totally selfish and evil is it really legal the oil companies will be spreading millions on propaganda about climate change and pollution just for their own profit margin etc etc let hopethat never happens
got to say it a bit frustrating that you guys ca seem to make a connection between weather that is changing over a period of time and the well understood impacts of climate change those scientists they definitely said things were going to change but no the new culprit is a direct energy weapon and haarp ffs
bruh idk what church you just walked out of but by definition born agains believe they are the only good people and that everyone else is going to hell there is also a strong tendency with them toward christian nationalism which is the epitome of entitlement you met every one of them lmao i can see with my own eyes what they are doing and saying as a group it like if i said scientists say climate change is man made and you responded have you met every scientist seriously get a grip
tim crosland sentenced to a fine for criminal contempt of court for releasing the judgement on heathrow expansion a day early quite possibly the first prosecution for criminal contempt due to the release of an embargoed sc ruling avoids prison sentence judges dismissed the defences of freedom of expression the draft was circulated for corrections and was only a temporary embargo as it always has been and defence of his actions were proportional to the impact of climate change because there is no such thing as justifiable contempt of court his disagreement with the ruling did not provide any defence that his actions justified especially when one considers the ruling was to be published the very next day thx to dominic casciani for live tweeting quite an interesting one and a bit different than the labour cascade going on
there is huge money in studies that seek a better understanding of how climate change is effecting us and how it will increasingly effect us because of how significant the threat is over the next years climate change will cause serious problems of international security as such the more we understand the better off we be there probably are some academics that are gaming the system to get funding in the same way that all academics chose their research based on what is on the cutting edge what is irrelevant to the modern world that said i sure that most academics steer their research into climate change relevance because of the possibility that they may have an opportunity to help protect the planet from those that seem so eager to destroy it i looking at you
to jump off on where finished there the deforestation component in terms of keeping up with the beef demand demand is no longer met with having cows bred on existing grass plains in south america brazil is cutting down rainforested areas at an unprecedented rate all in the name of making a few bucks on beef that ecosystem will be lost for a millennia even if we stop and try to let it revert back now the example that the west sets our lifestyle is enamoured by all those who have nothing people looking to profit in trying to provide a bit of this paradise to them are doing so by exploiting natural resources some here have called the left foolish by wanting to make it about climate change but that only just a small part why should we have it all ca there be a better way to go about spending our time on this planet it plain luck that our parents knocked boots on a certain piece of dirt on this rock we call earth we lose nothing and possibly gain by engaging in a more plant based diet even if it just for no meat monday while i do think your opinion is an unpopular one plenty of people share your perspective it not popular on this platform thus take my upvote crazy thing is it only an opinion and opinions can change i hope you can find the time to look more into this topic and educate yourself from the other side if you have already august was earth overshoot day a day that scientists calculate our population consumes the resources the planet capacity to regenerate this calendar year that pretty fucked in and will only get worse if we do do something about it we may seem insignificant on a singular level but as a whole that how change can come about little by little a little becomes a lot
i think for a lot of people their platform on climate change was a big part of not voting for them or their platform on lgbtq rights or aboriginal affairs or the economy their whole argument is hurrdurr trudeau bad
okay but an attempt was made to clarify the methodology so we can move beyond this is new and not well understood by the public with the antivaxer example i have also seen how computer driven models were treated with unwarranted skepticism to deny climate change rather then point to any exact flaw it was dismissed through the similar incredulous tactics it too new it impossible to decorrelate the data etc to those who take the time to study the material and be dismissed as being in a club is well disheartening
well i mean if you had read even the thesis to the page climate report put out by the un you understand that climate change refers to the increased frequency and magnitude of climatological anomalies as well as well as significant deviation away from historical trends
i think if the world went into nuclear meltdown the earth climate would change so much it would basically kill almost everybody
dude i very happy you feel that positively about having children i really am but you have to understand not everyone feels the same way not everyone feels like the whole circle of life and all that other stuff you mentioned is wonderful i do not want any children i know what it like to help raise a kid i helped raise and take care of my sister until she was ten i personally love my time freedom to enjoy other aspects of life like traveling and exploration and financial freedom more than children i also believe that the world is going to shit because of climate change economic difficulty of living etc and it is cruel of me to bring another child into this world to live through that i know i do want children at all and will never change my mind or feel devastated when i get older i gotten suicidal thoughts when my ex got pregnancy scares that how badly i do want them have gotten my vasectomy yet but hopefully soon next year children are not a critical component in life just because it part of living it something that people make an active choice to do it is also something that people can actively choose not to do please answer me this why am i and op making the wrong decision for choosing not to have a child permanently but others especially at my young age who choose to have children are right again you have to remember not everyone shares your opinion on the joys and beauty of children and parenthood
nope nope and nope a purity test never works as long as us democracy is enacted with first past the post voting system exactly because the winner takes all fringe support for outsiders does not work except adversely besides the biggest and staunched climate change deniers are on the other side of the isle to get buttigieg or anyone else to more strongly support climate change measures it is more effective to protest against the biggest deniers not the moderates
thanks for your answer i like to ask a follow up before my reply if we could save the earth from climate change what amount of economic loss would you be willing to live with to do it i think the train has indeed left the tracks but it more about the saving more of the children tied to the rails in it path if we slow the train down and stop it there is no doubt that some climate change has happened and will continue to happen but we may do have the ability to stop the worst and most catastrophic effects the idea of building a very free and open green economy of the future is very exciting and with a form of friedman negative income tax i could see individual liberty being so at hand a home with it own source of energy and other renewable resources alongside an electric car is such a great foundation for a free society but if we let the planet collapse it all for naught it frustrating to me that this issue is considered conservative the idea of reducing emissions eating less mass agriculture products and consuming less seems incredibly conservative which is why i think chomsky considers the modern conservatives radical in many ways
do worry too much climate change is likely to bring with it reduced availability of food we may start becoming thin again before the end of the century
notice they have no policy proposals none for a long time now republicans have put nothing forward in any issue other than tax cuts and deregulation and those have solved absolutely none of the problems of the common person they empty hollow neutered they do have answers on immigration gun control healthcare climate change wages all they have is opposition to whatever is put out there they make fun of the gnd they outright reject any gun concerns they deny climate change this is what right parties in every country do just spit in from the sidelines but prove to be completely incapable of drafting meaningful and effective legislation to address the problems when they come to power
a similar scenario occurred in the uk about years ago where the association of british insurers abi refused to provide insurance cover to entire towns regions due to increased flood risks i was a part of the abi internal analysis project which determined that the main causes of the increased flooding was a combination of shitty upkeep of existing infrastructure funding cuts in parks and rivers maintenance since the late and building sprawling suburbs on what was previously green belt it was convenient for the government to blame the floods exclusively on climate change the abi took the findings to westminster to which government agreed to up expenditure on infrastructure dredging rivers etc in exchange for the abi providing cheap insurance to these problematic areas the abi met its part of the bargain however suprise suprise the government failed to meet its commitments i work for a major insurer now in australia and i seeing some of the same patterns emerge with the qld and nsw govs following discussions
climate change is a chinese conspiracy says trump am i right dj
what happened to ozone layer theory that turned into global warming that turned into global cooling that now just climate change i thought the world was already doomed years ago according to scientists and politicians like al gore why do elites ride around in private jets and have mansions if they truly believe in their carbon emissions narrative
but i m going with the definition you gave i admitted i was biased because i was defining a bias as any type of being less preferential towards by your definition that you gave me i am not biased it is entirely fair okay but you have nothing to go off of never has trudeau ever hinted or suggested that he wants to destroy all human life and how would this bill achieve this is literally on record down playing res school at ryerson the cons literally voted no to climate change on the platform my scenario is a lot more in the realm of reality than yours you re just sea lioning at this point
actually how about turning it off ac uses a ton of energy and is one of the major contributing factors to the climate change
we got another option available to us one who has a decent plan for dealing with beat one who spoke out last october about how we were joebiden we are not prepared for a pandemic trump has rolled back progress president obama and i made to strengthen global health security we need leadership that builds public trust focuses on real threats and mobilizes the world to stop outbreaks before they reach our shores if you want biden in office vote help others register and overwhelm the ballot box but do just talk about it here how to put that into action check your voter registration and update as you must update your voter registration after you move after a name change and if your registration might have been purged because republicans felt like it voter outreach makes a huge difference right now much of it is phone banking which you can do from home if you can afford it give it takes money to hire organizers and run ads trump has raised more cash on hand than presidential race you can attend a fundraiser like one of these climate change virtual discussion with al gore climate change conversation on education in a world with jill biden clean energy conversation with nm gov michelle lujan grisham and rep paul tonko clean energy get up stand up music and conversation with senator kamala harris and beverly bond diplo dj cassidy d nice hannah bronfman and jermaine dupri a or simply give what right for support democrats up and down the ballot having support in the senate makes legislation possible there close senate races in az co me mt nc al ga both ia amp ks this year help a few democrats out talk with friends put up a facebook twitter instagram or snapchat post your word counts with people you know join r joebiden and r votedem
political climate change is real
the approval of the project is also the approval of the extinction of the population said ross dixon of the raincoast conservation foundation no one is disputing it nobody is saying that not accurate it been accepted the noise of the propeller and the engine emits at a frequency that can mask the communication of the whales she said and the overall traffic combines to create sort of a din so it reduces the actual space over which the whale can hear and be heard by other whales climate change has steadily diminished the availability of chinook salmon the whales main food source drone research has revealed whales with altered body shapes and lacking fat deposits suggesting they are starving you can visibly actually see the ribs on some of these whales said macduffee but gimme more monies that i need for my dank new inch tv
oh ffs people just do get it yes you still need a source of ignition climate change does light fires it is a part a of the cause of the conditions that allow the fires to get as bad as they are
there was no political rhetoric to try to sift through it was just the science explained in a simple way so anyone can understand the science of climate change should have been explained to you in grade school it is a failing of the education system that basic physics was not communicated to you in an effective manner however i have a question prior to watching this episode upon what evidence were your doubts founded i mean no mean no avarice nor admonition i do not mean to purport any political agenda i truly do not understand how an informed intelligent person could ever fail to see mankind effect on climate did you not understand the data presented were you convinced by misinformation did you not pursue data i would like to know so that i may hopefully use the information to sway others like you
sounds like you from one of the nordic countries you guys are doing a phenomenal job but it not going to matter climate change is global not localised china usa india indonesia brazil and russia are causing enough damage to fuck it up for everyone else
yes they are if you are devout to the the most extreme climate change predictions you drummed out and called a science denier science is about coming up with a theory and then silencing anything that even remotely goes against it it about trying to understand something and not rooting for one side or the other to let the actual facts to drive the argument not ideologies
yeah it was just a coincidence the real one was climate change
snopes made a good article on it imo
yes climate change is no respecter of human set boundaries also the guns thing is really spotty across america so a lot of us here will totally get where all are coming from glad you here
this is a nice if optimistic approach but i hope he right i am concerned that the idea that the ship of civilization will somehow self correct simply because it always has in the past might be wrong this time it not just increases in productivity and gdp it also and era of increasing inequality and climate change where a lot of unknown new economic factors might tip the boat in an unforeseen direction
more than the partisanship and bickering it is valuing education if you value education half the shit or more becomes a nonissue there is no arguing of climate change because empirical data shows how and points to acceleration by man many of the divisive issues simply become logical thought processes we are also losing the ability to critically think about issues beyond the talking points espoused by pundits on both sides we need education to be important again it not seen as a way to better your life anymore education has become a monotonous requirement instead of a way to a better life and it killing the country
climate change day after tomorrow also global warming is a myth because why is there still snow edit formatting
bernie considers global warming the most valuable change to national security he opposed the building of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a huge effect on the climate bernie bot
it ambiguous one of those things that people make assumptions about in their own heads without ever checking to see if everyone is on the same page i met omnivores who asked me if ethical meant i did eat meat for religious reasons the fact of the matter is that environmental concerns are a subset of ethical concerns as are concerns of animals suffering there are even strong humanitarian and social arguments for going vegan which also fall under the category of ethical concerns also calling animal sentience an ethical concern without admitting the same for all the other reasons does sort of convey a sense of arbitrariness or perhaps lack of rationality about the subject some of us do push back on the notion that concerns involving animals are somehow much more arbitrary than environmental concerns both concerns can be understood from ethical and scientific perspectives imo when animal sentience is left on it own in the ethical bin in discussions people are liable to forget this in their quest to categorize vegans as rational environmental or irrational crazy activist ethical the science is very clear on climate change however science is based on making the best judgements possible given the current information risks and benefits in cognitive science the best information suggests that non human animals are suffering for the sake of human luxury and cultural norms imo it is irrational to ignore this simply because one enjoys the taste of meat the truly rational response is to evaluate the currently available evidence ask oneself what this says regardless of what feels comfortable when i did this i realized my reasons for eating meat had to have been either inconsistent with the assumptions underlying human rights it is wrong to cause grave suffering for hedonistic reasons or inconsistent with the current evidence non human animals most likely suffer greatly in farms amp slaughterhouses i was unwilling to ignore or change the other two so i quit eating meat instead
i am capitalism socialism show me a working example and point out how it can work using that and i have no reason to oppose it climate change explain to me why there no reasonable debate where the two sides accepts and respects the other sides opinion and i have no reason to believe it overblown by people defense mechanisms feminism prove the patriarchy and disprove the opposing viewpoint and i change my mind abortion impossible i already see both viewpoints and consider both mostly right religion not religious sports not sure what to change here music never nickelback is the best band that have and will ever exist damnit i was so close
it deliciously orwellian that those calling out the bunk science of the climate change hoax are called anti science the models have failed to be accurate for years it almost satire at this point
baby i bleeding hits harder than the reality of climate change
i do want to flex about this since its not strictly speaking relevant but i have a phd in chemical engineering and while that not directly applicable i sessionally taught a year eng phys course on energy systems for two years so i consider myself more or less an expert on this topic teaching physics does really make you an expert on the energy industry myself i studied electrical engineering and now work in the field doing inspections mainly focusing on nuclear and hydro generating plants around the world i also do claim to be an expert on anything outside of my job i have an opinion on matters and have some inside knowledge of the energy industry but i no expert he would start planning something to replace this lost capacity lost capacity can easily be picked up by other sectors for some reason you using the worst sector in gas saying that it going to pick up most of the lost energy it not hydro for example is currently only at capacity during high demand at the moment wind turbines even though i think they overrated can also easily be activated to pick up some of the remaining gaps you acting as if we just going to fire up a bunch of old diesel generators if doug gave a shit about climate change he would start planning something to replace this lost capacity stuff like this takes time you ca just go full greta thunberg and demand results immediately we going in the right direction with provinces investing in more nuclear generation
the amount of evidence for anthropogenic climate change is insane and not caring for the environment will be our ultimate undoing as a species
look i actually read greta thunberg parents fucked up movement manifesto and it fucking awful here a few select points that were put down on their manifesto taking away nuclear power if you are against nuclear power then you do have a brain i sorry but saying nuclear power is awful and horrible we against it all i hear is i do understand science one single bit and i a fucking moron my favourite one greta movement seeks to make climate change a gendered issue yes you read that right climate change affected women more than men so we need to try for laws which protect women total bullshit pave the way for reparations to be paid to countries affected by other countries pollution sounds reasonable right one country polluting the fuck out of another country should be recompensed for it right that would work if there were private fucking companies how do you make countries pay reparations for a private companies actions in another country under the laws of that country it fucking insanity you obeyed the pollution laws of this country but this girl and her parents said you polluted it too much so the country where the company was created should pay reparations i read this years ago when people were busy arguing over the idiot girl saying how dare you i do know how people thought that was powerful she an anti science misandristic figurehead in conclusion greta thunberg is a useful pawn for her fucking idiot parents to swindle a ton of money out of well meaning idiots who did even read what she wanted to accomplish she could have had kill all black people in the manifesto and people still would have noticed fucking idiots
they are stronger and produce less we need to get off of fossil fuels because of climate change
co relation from yesterdays map climate change deniers alberta has a very young population with the highest climate change deniers i was led to believe that younger populations were more likely to embrace the facts of climate change than older alberta is a paradox i suppose
yes i know why would you be even if free degrees was actually going to happen it would affect you not unless it came with a debt jubilee and even then the financial benefit to you would adjust your risk reward weighting like trying to get a boomer to care about climate change does affect them and they make more money by rolling their eyes
you right about the powerful influence the gravity of the moon has on our physical and mental stability our oceans are the most powerful natural forces on this earth and they are even greatly effected by the moon pull women menstrual cycles are timed the same as moon cycles people have always been known to act strange during a full moon recently i read this and i think it has a lot to do with a change in the gravity of the earth and how people behave it scary
my real job is about as real as climate change

you misinterpret the danger of perturbations the fluctuations that you see in that graph are a result of milankovitch cycles they happen over years and if you look more closely at that graph you see that we should be slowly entering a fairly stable regime followed by a long and slow uptick in temperatures this is why the last years is important we evolved over the last million and our agriculture is suited to the climate of the last if we suddenly injecting an unprecedented variable into the equation we forcing global climate out of that long slow cycle and into territory where we really do know what to predict not to mention the fact that when ecosystems change slowly over years they have a chance for natural selection to respond in kind when the same temperature fluctuation happens over a year period nothing has the time to respond and mass extinctions are to be expected it not that climate change is impossible over the course of the planet history it that it happening much too fast right now we the primary drivers and very bright scientists see this unfolding very badly for us add to that the fact that your point about carbon following temperature is actually more dangerous for us not less if we seeing temperature trend inversions independent of the natural forcing then we doing it in addition to the natural system and this is potentially very dangerous not to mention the fact that your last point is faulty if it only took years to upend a milankovitch cycle and send us into a temperature spike then why exactly is it unreasonable to expect that a year concerted effort to favor low carbon technology could produce results in a similar time frame
imaging thinking you helping by skipping school to stand outside with signs instead of studying hard and focusing on literally any subject because they all have a role to play in adjusting to and preventing climate change i fucking hate how environmentalism was coopted by socialists
oh my god where do i begin stop talking about race relations feminism donald trump climate change we get it worthless celebrities income inequality just stop complaining
there are millions spent by nasa studying this shit and the dod the scientists they employ say human caused climate change is real it takes a special delusion to think alllllll those folks are in on some giant convoluted conspiracy for what exactly
renewable energy might be profitable still waiting on that but fighting climate change sure wo be

speaking to the intersection of infectious diseases and national security i curious about how often you and those in your field hear talk about climate change and vector borne diseases and the potential role they would play in destabilizing already weak subtropical governments by adding an additional source of chaos and another layer of expenses the malaria climate connection has been for some time now but do you see much discussion of climate within the infectious disease community or is it something that only a few niche inter disciplinarians get into
a lot of shit pandemic political infighting and instability climate change rising inability to effectively enact meaningful progress
if someone says they do care about the spy bill to you that is a problem that could have been rectified if they were taught how to think critically about the government hence why i extrapolating that you must think arts teaches you a correct or proper way to think about such things i put the words in quotes to highlight their subjective nature the author brings up climate change economic turmoil and international conflict in a similar context if only everyone were educated as an art grad we could pass progressive legislation and make all those problems go away
the ongoing impact of climate change on coffee is legit something i think about daily learning more about coffee production and the associated difficulties made me a very nervous addict lmao
text version why in the face of all available evidence and despite apparent public consensus to the contrary would a person believe that the moon landings were faked are we entering a golden age of the conspiracy theory post truth society provides the perfect conditions for dubious theories to flourish but are some people more susceptible to conspiracy theories i want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news it fake phoney fake a few days ago i called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are they are the enemy of the people donald trump us news live news day two donald with on terrible dishonest journalists the lowest form of life has become one of the hallmarks of his fledgling administration but as many have noted this posturing echoes developments closer to home it was michael gove of course who claimed during the brexit campaign that people in this country have had enough of michael gove experts academics vote conspiracy theories why people need to believe that the truth is hidden out there scott pruitt the new chief of the us environmental protection agency certainly seems comfortable dismissing scientific epa scott pruitt carbon dioxide global warming climate change i believe that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact so no i would not agree that it a primary contributor to the global warming that we see from a certain perspective this is knockabout political theatre and a little scepticism is prudent for sure blithely accepting whatever we told is clearly unwise information can be unreliable cover ups do occur but if we dismiss everything we hear in the media if we assume that scientists and scholars are papers l we leave ourselves vulnerable to manipulation misinformation and rumour this makes us wonder are we entering a golden age of the conspiracy theory not that this type of cognitive error is new of course the idea that individuals or groups have conspired to commit some crime and then cover it up reaches back centuries witness for example the belief that jews were poisoning wells and killing christians or that roman catholics were secretly plotting to undermine the protestant english state however if we now living in a post truth society with traditionally trusted sources of information routinely undermined and informal communication possible like never before via the internet one of the dubious fruits of this febrile climate may be a growth in the power and reach of conspiracy theories what makes such ideas so credible for some people why in the face of all available evidence and despite apparent public consensus to the contrary would a person believe that the moon landings were profile that the aids virus was created by the us pmc articles or that the british security services murdered princess brits princess dianas death was not to prevent a marriage to the muslim dodi al fayed are some groups more likely to endorse conspiracy theories than others and if so what do we know about the characteristics of these people as we discovered when we went looking for answers to these questions specific scientific studies of conspiracy web discourse sunstein conspiracy are few and far between and so we began by seeing what we could discover from general epidemiological surveys mining their findings in search of associations between particular social and psychological factors and a belief in conspiracy theories with richard bentall of the university of liverpool we turned to the rich dataset of one of the largest surveys of psychological health ever carried out the us national comorbidity survey the ncs r is a few years old now it was carried out in predating the current skeptical turn but it was large nationally representative and scientifically robust the results of our research are published today why are conspiracy theories so attractive podcast read more the ncs r covers a lot of ground but one of the statements participants were asked to consider was this i convinced there a conspiracy behind many things in the world more than a quarter of those who responded to the item felt that it was true a statistic that provides food for thought in itself and that was fifteen years ago these people had several things in common they were for example more likely to be male and unmarried but what really struck us were the above average levels of social disadvantage here was a group with lower levels of education and income they were more likely to be from an ethnic minority they were more likely to carry a weapon religious attendance may help mitigate some of the effects of doi this group was far less likely to go to services journals it was just demographic characteristics that the conspiracy theorists shared they tended to report lower levels of physical and psychological wellbeing and to see themselves as socially inferior both in comparison to their local community and to the nation as a whole they were more likely to have seriously considered suicide their social networks were weaker they often felt for example that they could rely on friends and family in times of trouble and they found it harder to maintain secure relationships childhood relationships with parents had frequently been challenging often these individuals had lived with both biological parents they spent extended periods away from home or had experienced violence at the hands of their parents finally the conspiracy theorists were more likely to meet the criteria for all types of psychological pmc articles pdf including anxiety depression adhd and alcohol and drug problems what we see then is a clear association between a belief in conspiracy theories and a wide range of negative life circumstances and personal distress so far an association is all it is do these types of problems make the people affected especially susceptible to conspiracy theories or is it the other way around that research has been done but our view is that the low self esteem smaller social networks and marginalisation we see in so many of the us sample may play a key role at an early age providing fertile ground for a distrust of authority feeling that society has rejected them they learn to reject the beliefs that society endorses experiences like this in childhood may have a lasting effect on the way we make sense of the world when an event occurs that does fit our expectations or that seems threatening we feel anxious and disturbed we want certainty and reassurance rather than thinking it through we liable to jump to conclusions to look for the answers that conform to our preconceptions rather than calmly weighing up the evidence the upshot of that process may be a conspiracy theory in the short term it a belief that brings benefits in place of anxiety and uncertainty we are soothed by what feels like knowledge our bruised self esteem is boosted by the sense that we are one of the small minority who really know what going on and thanks to the internet we able to connect with these like minded souls suddenly we can feel part of a community psychological models of conspiracy theories need testing for sure indeed we do know enough about conspiracy theories full stop but given the current socio political climate has this kind of research ever been more necessary daniel and jason can be found on twitter as and
do these people lose their kinds when protestors slow down traffic to bring awareness to climate change
good post to add to your last point that is what i believe the real threat to our safety and the world safety is if we really want to avoid conflict we have to tackle climate change and the issue of how we share resources that will be the cause of any future conflict and will lead to further displacement until we start to make dealing with this a priority and avoid military conflicts abroad which further destabalises regions of the world the world is going to get more unsafe we have the technology we have enough wealth to share we just have to do it i watched a talk recently about how much water it takes for certain foods how much resources we use and how certain areas of the world will experience severe droughts and increasing amounts of arid land i am convinced that solving these issues will be the biggest deterrent
i know how climate change work my joke was if climate change was making things cooler we would be drilling for methane which is way worse than just to speed things up
capitalism is also the economic system to enslave the most people it the most corrupt economic system it the most pessimistic economic system it the economic system which has led to there being more empty houses in london than there are homeless people it the economic system which has seen a huge amount of worker exploitation even today amazon warehouses iphone factories clothing production etc it the economic system which has led to corporations controlling decision making in governments rather than the people it the economic system which has seen the gdp of western countries increase since while worker wages are still lower than they were back then when taking inflation into account it the economic system which has led to massive exploitation of the planets resources in the name of consumerism it the economic system which has produced a new iphone every year whether we wanted one or not it arguably the economic system which has caused climate change it the economic system in which people are scared of robots making production more efficient it a pretty fucked up economic system when you think about it
my guy the right does think anthropogenic climate change is real despite the consensus the the overwhelming majority of scientists they continue to push abstinence only sex education despite a complete consensus that it does work the right is demonstrably not the party of science
correct and the first thing that comes to my mind is the current climate change crisis some article i read said that doom and gloom has already set in amongst scientists but it is may be being covered up it covered the personal issues of some of them but basically the impression was that we already screwed and the negative climate change consequences are possibly much much worse than we are led to believe so yeah pluto energies will be both good and bad in the coming years and a few months ago i posted a concern about an upcoming super conjunction between the sun saturn and pluto around january in and what concerned me about it was that pluto will likely be much closer to the ecliptic line high inclination orbit and all that meaning much more focused plutonian energies afaik lol sorry if this was a wall of text
that almost one third also think climate change is a hoax actual babies are aborted lgbtq is contagious and their sky faery magic is real if they pray hard enough
it really is a shit ass defence god knows why so many people are fine with it why is everyone on here who liked that inane comment not going off and worrying about climate change instead
the spending that you mentioned is spending by the government it individual spending if individuals or businesses want to spend their money on space exploration then by all means they can and should do so the satellites that you mentioned do benefit us on earth but what benefit does doing things like sending a rover to mars or sending probes to other planets or galaxies do to benefit us if private companies want to do this then that fine but i see no reason for governments to be funding these types of things also as for the satellites for weather climate research if the money used for space exploration were used for climate change weather research then who to say that sending satellites into space would be secondary discoveries in this type of research which would be much more beneficial to people on earth
just go vegan it easier than ever you do have to do it for the animals just do it i do want the world to burn because of climate change and fucking bacteria we do have any weapons against but yeah vegans are the extremists edit yes downvoting this will solve all those problems
i use consumerism globalization as an example to to threat they use climate change i explain to them the problem is india and china on how billions of people living in poor conditions are making the biggest impact on pollution and it all because of the globalization the love so much they wo listen or accept this is the reality they ca think passed their noses
the hypothesis of man made climate change is completely un scientific it un falseafiable fraction of a degree warmer within the statistical margin of error climate change coldest winter on record climate change more or less storm activity obviously climate change every climate catastrophe computer model for the last years proven wrong stealth climate change
let overflow the public transport system one of the solutions to the problem of climate change is more public transport let show govt that we need more busses and trains or walk to work it good for your health and good for the planet this is going to work well for rural new zealand no public transport no side walks and too far distances to walk anyway
then they use climate change as a security threat and redirect money to address that this is just bad policy this is a great example of the lack of logical forethought and short minded policy standards typical of fiscal conservatives
this deserves more upvotes climate change now and in the long term will probably continue to make food more expensive
nearly every company on the list is a fossil fuel company and the study defines emissions from the company as any time a downstream user combusts one of their products it literally only tells us that the fact that people combust fossil fuels is the leading cause of climate change
facing extinction people would put all their money and effort into an invention like that first they have to face it many are second they have to value not their own future but the future of other generations above their own and particularly above their own wealth and comfort nah humans are the most advanced being the planet has produced but we have advanced far enough to be able to rise above petty squabbles and to work for the common good we still having wars for pete sake at a time when we should be leveraging science and what it tells us we have huge swaths of people denying climate change denying vaccinations afraid of gmo denying evolution denying the big bang minimizing or eliminating sex education against same sex marriage against equality believing the world is flat not a joke and on and on and on hell most still believe there an all powerful creator being who watches over loves us and who will protects us no we are in the second dark ages and are going to get exactly what we deserve our own extinction
this is very true and how we should approach climate change issues with china except virtue signalling if you ask me that an insulting buzzword
every capitalist country in the world is facing major problems climate change being the most damaging
the us is hardly considered having a functioning democracy by other countries lol eh we backsliding a bit but we still well within the boundaries of what is considered to be a democratic nation by international news that just dictatorship no it realpolitik it america seeing russia and china look hungrily at ukraine and taiwan and in response hold a gun to their heads and say try it bitch there was a brief period after wwii where the us did maintain a large standing military with the intent of deterrence the korean war was the result we learned our lesson and the rest is history they just wait until you bleed out financially and emotionally china and russia are far more likely to do that than us new york city yes nyc not the state has a larger gdp than all of russia the only reason we have to take them somewhat seriously is because of their aggressive posture and their nuclear arsenal beyond that they a run down gas station that pretends it a strong country and both the russians and the chinese are staring down the barrel of enormous demographic crisises china in particular is on the precipice of the largest demographic crisis in history million working adults supporting million retirees does not a superpower make with a country so torn a democracy so weak people and areas so poor an infrastructure and educational system so catastrophic it just a matter of time eh we been through worse scrapes and as far as being the most powerful nation on earth time is on our side right now immigration true we do really need to reform our immigration policies to become more welcoming though it may well be the case that climate change will drive larger and larger immigration trains towards us start really working with what specifically would you suggest do be vague say what you specifically like us to do take a stronger stance against china or russia start developing a pacific equivalent of nato pursue more free trade agreements with our partners and allies an invasion is either the last time we invaded anyone was like years ago
this is such an ignorant question with so many ignorant comments for humans a whole foods plant based diet is optimal for dogs it viable but not trivial for cats which are obligate carnivores it should be criminal for sharks this is just a troll post wake up shitposts against vegans when they the best chance we have in the fight against climate change are just pathetic
yes it is labeling anyone who does nt support you as dissident is fascistic refusing to engage with an opposite opinion is fascistic your refusal to engage with someone who is nt supportive is the behavior that marginalizes people its the exact cause of the divisiveness happening in our country right now you do just get to blame trump and wash your hands of the same toxic behavior you asking me to vote for a candidate and you wo nt even bother to defend him and fyi trumps presidency has shown how easy it is to derail any climate change progress its a constant issue that will be a factor in every election its not the basis for presidential voting local politicians who control zoning and enforcement have way more effect on what is and is nt done by are the cause of over of greenhouse gasses
i did claim heat pumps come or have to come from germany i would expect you to pay more attention to what i am writing otherwise it not worth my effort as for installing them en masse i have explained in detail above that the real problem is not with the heat pumps but with the system around such as insulation central heating suitable radiators as for german leadership the german ministry for the economy and climate change has been working intensively on the problem for months now the current plan is to get rid of russian gas within year time and heat pumps are a part of it of course which is way more ambitious than the current plan by the eu commission for the eu as a whole where the timeframe is years so germany is showing leadership here
indeed this is not the consensus all dietary bodies and heart health institutions are well aware of the benefits of replacing saturated fats with poly unsaturated fats the nutrivore article i shared does have an amateur meta analysis including inclusion criteria this essentially boils down to cholesterol denialism specifically regarding ldl which is the nutrition equivalent of denying climate change i would ask this user what they think of ldl but i feel i can guess
listening to him talk about their plans for climate change was rough
pretty much everyone believes in climate change the climate is changing and always has i think most people believe that man has a role in it the linkage to extreme weather events seems much weaker
it will probably still be the keystone pipeline although i still hoping climate change would be at the top of the list though which is more important than gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana
this is such bullshit french here even the autor states that frontal armed resistance against the heavily armed and experienced wehrmacht and waffen ss would have been suicide of course it would have been but it was hamstrung by a lack of equipment equipment that would have been easier to come by were it not for the ban on the civilian ownership of war weapons and the registration of non hunting guns bullcrap it was war and the country was occupied you surely know that nazi in an occupied country takes control of everything administrations and such of course but also possessions and as a matter of facts weapons every kind of weapon was confiscated as soon as france signed vichy surrender would you have an arm with a non ban it would have been confiscated in the same way what would people have done resist do give up their weapons against a heavily trained army the resistance was not inhibited by the lack of arms the resistance had plenty of arms thanks to the allies that parachuted a lot and to the acts of sabotage guerilla when they could steal weapons the resistance was inhibited by the nazi repression in the occupied country when you leave in a constant climate of fear when you see people getting arbitrarily killed in the street just meters from you when every word and action from you can get you arrested and deported that is what inhibited the resistance not the so called lack of arms that would have change nothing at all this bullcrap article is a profond disrespect to the resistance that gave everything to support france freedom
lol apparently it does left and right are defined by the political climate in the us that liberal and conservative both are capitalist because our economy is capitalist your semantics wo change that socialism is represented in the us it radical left socialist policies are barely in the us overton window you do get to redefine our political parlance in marxist terms and economic policy is the only thing that exists in politics anyway wiki centrism
the civil engineering is pretty bad lack of drainage in the cities in texas is more of contributing factor then climate change
growing inequality between poor and rich the poor have nothing so if the rich get richer then the gap gets bigger its inevitable portugal legalization of it portugal decriminalised it its still illegal to sell us drone strikes using the ramstein airforce base even though it is known they repeatedly shot civilians doing so this is a complex topic i do think its right to say the us target civilians of course civilians have been killed by us strikes but those strikes are important to prevent violent terrorist groups from operating regarding climate the eu carbon emissions have fallen quite a lot over the last years levels correspond to a reduction from levels which is more than the eu reduction target of by however most of the world carbon emissions come from asia and their emissions are rising steadily look at this graph to see how small eu emissions indicator its falling to less than of total emissions this year the idea that we have much control over climate change does not stand up to reality the only way we could prevent climate change is if we force resource rich countries and regions to phase out oil and gas extraction that requires strict multilateral agreements unilateral action in germany is fairly pointless it would only reduce fossil fuel prices further making them more accessible to billions of people around the world
do you think that just as many corps will be benefiting from climate change reforms it is clearly good for business and there is a huge eco washing of consumer goods and services there have been proposals they do actually have positive impact but sound good on paper carbon credits is a great example the proposed carbon tax is just as ludicrous the leading d candidate warren is for both the open border and carbon tax fyi these solutions just put off the problem the recent dem climate change forum in nyc was a lot of spitballing with no clear solutions one of the few major takeaways was that enviro issues can lead to more jobs and opportunity for business sound familiar the same bullshit applies with recent eu forums and reforms at one point critics revealed that the way one of the eu institutions had defined carbon offsets could lead to massive global deforestation it just deferring the problem and it a power grab for guys like inslee which is partly the impetus behind the ridiculous picture op has posted yes we humans need to do some things to help ourselves survive ourselves but it folly to think that one political party has this clearly mapped out and all of this shit flinging name calling and label making is not going to draw anybody to the center where shit can actually get done all got to drop the rhetoric and get together
he does genuinely think that everyone understands what the headline is implying there are factual ways to say that climate change negatively impacts more people of colour without describing it as racist which is a human characteristic it is an idiotic clickbait headline and whoever wrote it should not be in journalism and this person is saying he refuses to read it on that basis as do
threatening nuclear war with a crack pot dictatorship we do sound very different from ignoring climate change somehow getting on the wrong side of wwii years after the fact and basically ignoring any reality that does suit our immediate political needs is a valid perspective back when we only opposed evolution and stem cells it was more tolerable but now what do we offer
you not wrong but none of those things are new they know how the game works they know the media climate before they try and change complicated things why ca they settle on a message that gets cut through honestly with the staggering amount of things the libs have screwed up over the past years how can labor not capitalise i hate to say it but i think labor needs to accept that the leader has to be an all singing all dancing entertainer the atrocious polling for should have been enough to indicate people did want bill the wheels fell off the alp car and the engine never even started let not worry if the air freshener is wrong scent and the fuzzy dice are no longer fluffy
well this ca be according to the berners and the steiners clinton was just as bad as trump on climate change grats on pulling off possibly the largest false equivalency in world history
problem is anything that comes out of a constitutional convention in the current political climate will be a bigger by orders of magnitude shit show than the current constitutional problems the framers intentionally made the us constitution difficult but not impossible to change an amendment to restore accountability to the executive branch is definitely a good idea but a complete re write of the constitution would be a disaster the oligarchy would love nothing more than to tear it up and start from scratch that alone should be an argument against a constitutional convention
guys i know you are going to be dying of thrist and hunger as a result of climate change screwing over your farms but do worry the fact that boats from world countries move faster means we can give you more supplies more easily

definitely need to extend the federal unemployment to the end of the year the pandemic is spiking in a lot of states that had these genius repub governors that were in denial of the seriousness of this virus even states that have been slower opening up the numbers are still up no one is back to normal the only way this is going to turn into an even bigger financial disaster is to assist people with the economic recovery time that is necessary to keep the economy going another stimulus would be great but not nearly as essential as the added unemployment another stimulus payment has been brought up but i doubt it is going to be the same and definitely not higher although i have heard a couple comments from people who say trump would like to put out another one but larger sounds very unlike him or mcconnell but i am genuinely worried about this next month coming without the unemployment aid from the fed people that went out and celebrated from memorial day weekend until now have now passed this around at a higher rate i know we are back working and most of the workforce is still at home if we lucky enough to start seeing a change in the fall we still need that boost to keep consumer buying up the holidays will be here sooner than we realize and many families will be struggling lots of kids will be getting coal in their stockings lol if they do something by the end of july it definitely a political move although they do seem to have very smart instincts during this election year it the only way trump stands a chance with everything going on and the current political climate at this juncture in time we need it the banks and corporations do
i literally unable at this time to verify what they found for myself i unable to draw any conclusions i unable to validate for myself the science of climate change but if a reputable source tells me it is true then i it regardless of being able to read and comprehend the entire study faith in our experts is probably the biggest victim in the information age
she literally has had a healthcare plan healthcare is the number concern in this election cycle save for climate change but i do think people are as immediately concerned with that as they are medical bills that pretty vague
we not having environmental problems and a warmer earth is a good thing an ice age would be far more catastrophic as for the climate change theory i dispute the idea that there is a run away catastrophic effect from higher levels in addition to that the higher levels we have the better it is for plant life around the world
some scenarios in which a person would be afraid to share their political views an african american democrat who does believe in gay marriage lgbt rights an evangelical who is pro choice an nra member who believes in reducing clip sizes to decrease gun violence a climate change activist who ca deal with led lights a native bostinian supporting the yankees a person secretly supporting donald trump we live in wildly polarized times i surprised it only to be honest
they asked people if they believed in global warming i say because pr people started a campaign to call it climate change because it sounded less scary but people should be deathly afraid and people mostly said yes when asked if they believed it would directly affect them they mostly said no that where they mistaken mass extinction is talking about just humans it talking about of all living things on earth everytime it happens its like a giant reset button on the planet those basically even if they were in a place that they felt would affect them the earth is a finely tuned living organism that relies on every part of itself to be balanced and failure to do so tips it all to reset and the planet naturally self corrects
to make up for all the bombed out countries and doing nothing about their massive climate change contribution
can you point me to anything i said that is crazy my main point was that i see similarities in this toxic remnant church and other churches i been to in tn that are considered cults the same toxic culture permeates under the surface i ca help but link that to trumpism politics and the pandemic response i do want to experience climate change around people that do think it real among many other things all of the sociological measures i listed are highest in the south that is a fact you can look it up i hate watching disingenuous lizards smile and talk about god so they can get votes and ultimately hurt the rubes that voted for them yes there are pockets of crazy everywhere i actually traveled more than you i guess and lived abroad for less time my issue is that the crazy is contained in this one cult it a voting block creating policy that effects everyone
what actually happening here is you know this sub has some weird circle jerk against leo and his climate change remarks you think internet points are worth something and you trying to cash in on the circle jerk how do i know this there at least other posts right now with this exact video enjoy your downvote this is not relevant content to the sub also sorry that you think your points are worth anything the oscar speech was a great opportunity for someone important to get the word out leo commands great respect among many people i applaud him for standing up and saying it
here is the easily readable more technical a search for human influences on the thermal structure of the detecting greenhouse gas induced climate change with an optimal fingerprint view journals fulltext display continuity of ice sheet mass loss in greenland and antarctica from the grace and grace follow on doi
how about instead of changing mass behaviors we focus on how things are done why not look at the industry and find away to make it cleaner will this make it carbon neutral no but by doing this to every industry we will be way better off to much of fixing climate change relies on fixing behavior and not fixing the products themselves people do care how they get product x just as long as they have it when they need it think of small things like say plastic bags just have companies change to paper biodegradable bags not tell people to use less or bring their own we ca rely on that but what we can do is make it so when you need a bag for your groceries plastic is a option i truly believe people do care what they use just that when it comes time to needing a bag or straw or their meat it there for them
kinda sorta the issue was really how my classes collided i a chemical engineering business double major so although my business classes do nt clash with each other and my cheme classes do nt clash the business profs and cheme profs do nt communicate when it comes to scheduling shit plus i was a bit under the weather here at ut in downtown austin it got to degrees way too fucking fast man i a houston boi we ai used to this cold weather climate change is real and a problem you know apparently htown got snow before nyc and other northern cities wtf
that s very helpful info thanks however that only accounts for part of the issue the other risks we have include running out of material rare earth elements are by their nature rare and thus unsustainable the emissions caused by generating enough electricity to keep these new batteries charged and the emissions caused while recycling or not these batteries it also worth noting that you could completely eliminate passenger vehicles and we would still have rampant methane and other greenhouse gas induced climate change i not saying electric vehicles wo help putting cardboard in the recycling bin instead of the garbage bin even helps but to think this is anything approaching a viable solution on its own or worse thinking non military vehicles are the top cause of pollution is dangerous alternative green fuels and lubricants would be a more sustainable solution in my opinion they would also help farmers by being able to sell more of their crops including the soil cover grasses they use to protect their fields between farming seasons
that an entirely false comparison political science and actual science are entirely different and i like to note i have met a single marxist so far that does believe in climate change and claiming that something right just because its accepted is a textbook example of the argumentum ad populum fallacy
it empty words because trump has literally in no way demonstrated how he will reverse what you perceive as obama failings seriously what actionable ideas has he brought to the table to remedy any of the issues you raise build a wall is not a cure all he cites problems many of which are unfortunately inherent or embedded or will take decades to fix but he has no idea how to fix them you entitled to your opinion that obama been a failure but i can almost guarantee you that history will say otherwise race relations have not worsened under him social media has just brought them to the forefront there has been a month streak of job growth unemployment is at more americans are getting health insurance coverage roughly million since the aca and the rate of uninsured is the lowest it ever been we have made huge strides as a global leader in climate change gay marriage was legalized wall street reform he revived the auto industry signed a new gi bill what more do you want or are all your reasons ad hominem the answer is not regression there is a reason why the vast majority of intellectuals in america and abroad are anti trump
they can be easily sourced look at the citations below the percentages on that image i linked to consensus statements by academies of science american physical society statement on climate change the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earth physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now november american association for the advancement of science aaas board statement on climate change the scientific evidence is clear global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now and it is a growing threat to society december american chemical society statement on global climate change there is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real and particularly strong within the past years that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century july national academy of sciences understanding and responding to climate change the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere international academies joint science academies statement global response to climate change climate change is real there will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world climate however there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring national academies of science international academies the science of climate change despite increasing consensus on the science underpinning predictions of global climate change doubts have been expressed recently about the need to mitigate the risks posed by global climate change we do not consider such doubts justified national academies of science and there many others i been compiling a comprehensive list of statements most statements are signed by many academies the balance of the scientific evidence demands effective steps now to avert damaging changes to earth climate there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring the evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels retreating glaciers and changes to many physical and biological systems it is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities ipcc this warming has already led to changes in the earth climate it is unequivocal that the climate is changing and it is very likely that this is predominantly caused by the increasing human interference with the atmosphere these changes will transform the environmental conditions on earth unless counter measures are taken the problem of global warming climate change and their negative impact on the human life and the functioning of the whole society is one of the most dramatic of contemporary challenges the most recent studies indicate that the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased in the last century by about climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems the ipcc fourth assessment of climate change science concluded that large reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases principally are needed soon to slow the increase of atmospheric concentrations and avoid reaching unacceptable levels however climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated global emissions since have been higher than even the highest predictions arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid feedbacks in the climate system might lead to much more rapid climate changes the need for urgent action to address climate change is now indisputable it is widely agreed that human activities are changing earth climate beyond natural climatic fluctuations the emission and accumulation of greenhouse gases associated with the burning of fossil fuels along with other activities such as land use change are the principal causes of climate change climate change poses a significant threat to human health in many direct and indirect ways although there are some uncertainties about the magnitude of climate change and its impacts there is widespread consensus that to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact on health near term deep cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions are needed it is now more certain than ever based on many lines of evidence that humans are changing earth climate the atmosphere and oceans have warmed accompanied by sea level rise a strong decline in arctic sea ice and other climate related changes the evidence is clear however due to the nature of science not every single detail is ever totally settled or completely certain nor has every pertinent question yet been answered scientific evidence continues to be gathered around the world and assumptions and findings about climate change are continually analysed and tested the atmosphere ghg content has increased steadily and steadily in recent decades an in depth analysis of these ghgs particularly their isotopic composition shows unequivocally that this change in the composition of the atmosphere is directly or indirectly linked to human activity anthropogenic origin the speed of global climate change announced is likely to be unprecedented in these conditions the international community must resolutely and globally commit itself to a voluntarist and ambitious approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions the scientific evidence is now overwhelming that the climate is warming and that human activity is largely responsible for this change through emissions of greenhouse gases the science of climate change reported by the ipcc fourth assessment and fifth assessment have been thoroughly evaluated by numerous national academies royal society national academy of sciences royal swedish academy of sciences and by international bodies advances in science and technology have increased our knowledge of how to mitigate climate change uncertainties in the scientific analysis continue to be problem the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earth physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now the earth climate is now clearly out of balance and is warming the scientific evidence is clear global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now and it is a growing threat to society the geological society of america gsa supports the scientific conclusions that earth climate is changing the climate changes are due in part to human activities and the probable consequences of the climate changes will be significant and blind to geopolitical boundaries there is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real and particularly strong within the past years that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century
ronald reagan was a supporter of climate change regulations and when governor of california he signed one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country there is no doubt that a change was taking place in the republican party in the but the group of republicans that no longer found themselves welcome in the party as that change took place share many most policy positions with the moderate wing of the democratic party today
tragic and heart breaking are synonyms a criminal who shoots junk all day and robs banks and eventually dies in a gutter is still a tragedy even though they brought those events upon themselves even if humankind is responsible for climate change that does make our suffering any less tragic
broadening rule six may be too broad and ambiguous of a change it almost invites arguments it seems much more direct and probably more effective to just ban comments supporting specific topics we would essentially be broadening a class of comments that we already remove like racist and sexist content it seems like you have a pretty good list let put it on the wiki dismissing anthropogenic climate change promoting anti vaxx conspiracy theories evolution denialism flat earth promulgation medical advice that is not consistent with guidelines of major medical associations cannabis will cure your cancer
he does expose how stupid climate change is
scientists overwhelming do agree with this assessment and again you arguing the nuance of addressing a problem that not a defense of those who deny its very existence it not my duty to educate you on climate change you have failed your country that you are at a computer arguing it not that big of a deal and do access information yourself that will show climate change is among experts uncontroversial in its very real and present danger so lemme say again yes shame on you
biden supports lgbt rights does believe that climate change is a hoax and will be a stable but boring leader what there not to like
you do actually care about climate change if you do care about being persuasive then it about how this makes you feel
your future sorry not so good sweetie your chances of making it to adulthood without getting molested or worse is very low bc we do believe in feminism you really special only bc of the genes inside your eggs and once we get those well i hope you cook clean and have a high tolerance for domestic abuse and about those eggs they not yours i mean sure they your dna and inside your body but we get to tell you what to do with it hint it to reproduce with a white man we shame you for using it for any other purpose and deny you autonomy and proper healthcare for any fetal tissue let hope you were born gay bc we beat that out of you possibly destroy you financially as again you basically stole our eggs you have no respect for the work your father and friends put in to keeping non whites out just so they do spoil that seed and now you want to waste it on becky you just need a real man to make you straight the future is good sweetie we do believe in science so medical research is stalling climate change turned out to be real and we have no answers for diabetes and heart disease shut up and eat your hardee that the future for you this is white america something to be truly proud of
climate change
it the same as saying we can appease climate change by sacrificing cows to the gods would work in principle but encouraging this sort of thinking as valid is stupid scientism is usually a buzzword used by adherents of woo to dismiss criticism and this is no exception
let look at life in the simplest way if you are in a death situation in which you have to decide between saving yourself or let the other guy live on expense of your life instinctively your brain will make up the reasons why you should live before the other guy any reason age past errors etc the same happens in real world people would put their welfare first then everybody else it easy to imagine something that benefits everyone but when you are in the position to do it you will think on you first i know it sounds selfish but it just human nature that why there is corruption in government for example that why you observe people that has so much money they ca spend it all but they want more money that why you have corporate that does give a f about climate change because there money behind it and if there money behind it why would you stop
thanks to climate change it getting hot in here thanks to tinder so take off all your clothes thanks nelly
by the metric of climate change it still objectively untrue because trump does have sole control over the government and china is a worse polluter anyway
nan
climate change causes the world supplies of drinking water to dry up and countries go to war over the last drops
on the bright side humans adapt really well and she will have no concept of the world before climate change was regularly affecting it its like the kid in the walking dead and how well he can deal with shit compared to the old people that remember the past
he also spoken at length about various apocalypse scenarios several of them anthropogenic and says that we need to be doing more to combat pollution habitat destruction climate change and nuclear proliferation i mean just watch this it not optimistic at all in fact it quite horrifying
next you say climate change is real and the earth is years old watch something besides fox news
yes looking into it it seems i was misremembering them wanting to dim the sun itself but they do want to alter our atmosphere to reflect more sunlight away cooling the earth well seems like we do nt need any more cooling right now harvard lol
the government if i had a dollar for every post or comment in these ufo subs that assume a monolithic global government control office somewhere for god sake people read a book or a newspaper now and then there is no the government there are hundreds of nations on this planet there are thousands of governments within the united states alone and it obvious most of you around here believe the united states government which one controls not only everything that is seen flashing over a corn field somewhere in the usa but also the entire planet and the entire galaxy around it if you live in an american city or i guessing suburb for this group there are dozens of governments all around you and other than bitching at each other few of them have any idea what the others do there a civilian agency that handles airport traffic at the federal and regional levels there are state federal county and municipal governments that deal with air pollution highways farm animal food safety building regulations health departments social security and old age benefits toy packaging testing of dental hygiene products thousands of interactions regarding trade immigration climate change policy and wildlife movements between the many continents and hundreds of individual nations there is no all powerful government that controls anything on this planet governments of the largest richest countries do even control space flight or rocket launches or the thousands of spacex privately launched internet satellites now screwing up astronomy photography and research around the world have you heard about catastrophic climate change inflation supply chain breakdowns russia and the ukraine hong kong and taiwan the oceans heating up and our supplies of food in the oceans grinding to a halt how about the rapid population decline because people have stopped having children around the world and neither totalitarian china or here money to have a baby western europe can do anything about it please please take just a moment before you post these things and ask yourself what am i talking about when i claim the government is going to finally tell me about the space aliens what do i even mean
eight deadly sins pride greed envy wrath sloth gluttony lust human caused climate change denial oh look evangelical republicans elected the anti christ christians have been warning about the antichrist for years so when he finally shows up they vote for him
no one has even built a generation plant let alone a fucking assembly line for them russia has see the wiki the us has built several prototypes see experimental breeder reactor wiki nuscale is starting to build their first prototype of a factory built reactor wire them to a bunch of batteries to provide power the reason why nuclear is cheaper then renewables is storage if you actually think batteries are the solution you are mistaken let do some math the us uses almost twh annually divide that by and you get twh multiple that by weeks and you get twh divide that by mwh and multiple that by million the storage and cost of a tesla battery wear house and you get a cost of trillion the actual cost will be higher because of grid improvements required to utilize this storage so that gives an estimate of trillion for a mere weeks of storage that is not economically viable the real reason people are not pursuing nuclear is the cost of natural gas is currently very low it will still kill us but we will save a buck you see climate change is real
it not about removing the companies it about making sure they are held accountable for their emissions everyone going vegan is gon na change emissions for manufacturing industries oil industries exxonmobil has known for years about climate change they did share their info and just kept on emitting stop acting like companies are acting in good faith most of them are not most want to maximize profits and they do that by not giving a shit about the environment or wellbeing of their animals like i said most people wo even be able to afford to go fully vegan to substitute all the nutritients they miss this is exactly the type of arguing that lets companies get away with destroying our planet the world is running on the concept of infinite consumption on a planet with finite resources it not gon na last
this reminds me of when climate change deniers and evolution deniers go and get their own scientists who agree with their position oh yeah well college kids love obama so i m going to get my own college kids to say how he is bad and so is obamacare that will surely make my case
bleaching is really reversible it is as long as conditions do repeat it prolonged repeated bleaching events that cause death in the coral a single bleaching event wo kill a reef but considering climate change is going anywhere no amount of government money is going to be able to stop future bleaching events
not true and that a yr old video today climate change is pretty bad each year the world getting hotter every summer gen z are honestly the only generation who care the most about climate change and the environment imo we literally have done more protests than any other previous generation has done because we actually care about our future and the future of the earth unlike the older generations who pass away without seeing the repercussions they made and not to mention the uproar from most people when hearing or seeing the huge wildfire in australia that killed over a billion animals last year and also the fire that i think led to a wildfire caused by that dumb gender reveal party in la last year it upsetting there a lot of people who care that why there plenty of organisations out there do measure your carelessness to others
aldin number in relation to thermodynamics climate change and aldin gas were integral to vaush arguments in his appearance on modern day debate today really interesting stuff
well the idea is to try and disprove it until there enough evidence to say that it almost certainly fact at which point we have to work on the assumption that it true as with climate change
as someone who does believe in humans causing climate change could it be argued that as technology advances we being the market will be moving to green energies for economic reasons as they become cheaper and will be able to negate the effects of climate change without any legislation i not an expert on climate science but it sounds like you actually worked in the field to some extent
that because humanity is literally doomed no scientists of any credibility are arguing that climate change will render the human race completely extinct uncontrolled climate change will be disastrous and will potentially kill millions but we not going the way of the dinosaurs
the republicans clinging to power need the populace to be under educated it easier to control and manipulate under educated people that how they stay in power they demonize education bringing up shit like crt that is even a factor in public education until college really but they want what their kids learn to be very selective to the things that keep the republicans in charge if you start teaching them real history you realize it not so hunky dory all the time so they want to white wash and pretend we never committed atrocities in the settlement of this land they want kids to be good little neo christian racist ignorant wage slaves that do stir the pot and god forbid think for themselves i think the gqp knows this that the republican party is doomed if the populace is well educated so schools dive deeper into a state of state sponsored education just like the germans did during the rise of fascism in the early we would all be much more aware of this if our education system were so abused and neglected on purpose by the right hell the left politicians are complicit in this too it all a vicious cycle problem is we always the ones who get screwed not the politicians that being said though i know i right because why the fuck would betsy devos have any reason to be education secretary during the trump regime when she had absolutely zero qualifications for the role at every turn she was helping public schools get fucked more all the while ensuring rich private feeder schools were very well equipped paying teachers in public schools what we have allowed as the standard is an abomination that can only be explained as a sheer way to keep good people from wanting to do it so we always have this problem if you wanted the populace to be well educated teachers would be paid as well as doctors and lawyers there would be abundant resources for them not what we are seeing in real life the math thing is probably another way to retain control because if people ca do math science etc etc well they wo be researching climate change and no one will care any more about it while we all suffer from it and the powers that be can keep making money without doing anything about it i need a drink
neither have i so feel free to take your pc justice warrior mentality where it could actually be utilized for good instead of starting a debate with someone for saying a woman is gorgeous and looks younger than she is maybe stand up against racist speech or people actually objectifying women you could fight against animal abuse pollution climate change gun control there s so much shit that you could be doing instead of telling me i lack empathy towards women and need to do research on alison bechdel which has absolutely nothing to do with a man finding a woman attractive you have yourself and absolutely fantastic evening though because you beautiful despite your age
california has contended for over a century with an annual wildfire season but scientists have found that climate change including longer hotter and drier fire seasons diminishing snowpack and lengthening droughts have already measurably worsened the size and scale of fires in the western united states
the biggest eye opener for me was the price tag on those trucks plus the lift kits while they may be rednecks at heart they are no different from the little rich kids driving brand new audis and bmw maybe wealthier in fact that said nobody else is modifying their diesels to blast smoke clouds out their stacks to make fun of environmentalism not every lifted truck driver is a climate change denying jackass but many climate change denying jackasses drive lifted trucks
not that the fact that you disregarded studies that contradict your stance its not like i just pulling articles these are studies that put peoples professional reputations on the line also i not arguing that man made climate change is real and i not arguing that it is not a clear and present danger that everyone should be working to fix i am attacking hyperbole and alarmism that exaggerates or willfully misinterprets or ignores the findings of publicly avalible studies
most of the doom and gloom around climate change is vastly over rated people in the us for the most part will be fine people in other places will go from fine to completely fucked a whole lot of animals are going to die and the world is going to look really different in years but it will sustain human life just fine
and again not rejecting any scientific topics climate change is real i have knew that since i was like we got taught it in school not as much as burning fossil fuels rankles the shit of of the climate hippies hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
cool you can cherry pick one small detail of a larger picture to try to discredit it but the keystone pipeline being net carbon positive is a fact you ca contest that not even accounting for the lost jobs and lost opportunity of being the beneficiary of it need to be refined it was politicized it is beneficial to climate change in every way and it was cancelled due to politics just because you do want those things to be true does mean that they are just because it may not be impacting gas prices does neuter the rest of the point even if you want it to babe
i get you being topical and all but we are going to be looking back fondly on the ukraine situation given the level of fucked climate change is going to bring
we do have four more years to blow on climate change of the two candidates who is more likely to at least try to address it that might be all we get from biden but it better than nothing
do nt you think performing laboratory tests on the meat is better at finding potentially dangerous pathogens than just looking if each cow has symptoms looking for the symptoms is unecessary if lab tests are done also think about where you think pathogens are more likely to be a sterile laboratory that is constantly sanitized a pen farm packed with animals dirt etc you realize that we been manipulating the genetics of our foods for thousands of years right you do realize that most of the plants meat we eat has lost serious genetic diversity already it seems like you do nt really understand the effect of livestock on land programs is one article i also also seriously suggest looking through the literature also think about how some grazing manure production is good but enough to support everyone mest consumption can be disastrous for example all that extra fertilization runs into water bodies and causes scitable knowledge library eutrophication causes consequences and controls in you think reasearch on the health benefits effects of lab grown meat is nt being done and wo nt ever be done you acting like people are just going to eat it without regulation research beyond ethics what about how meat consumption contributes strongly to climate news making cattle more and water
the problem with a lot of scientists is that they mistakenly believe politicians to care about truth as defined in scientific terms as much as the scientists themselves nothing could be further from the truth a career politician only cares about the next election voter turnout if politicians made the rational and sensible choices they tout they making they would not have made half of europe dependent on gas imports from an aggressive imperialist mafia state and instead focused on energy independence but they did and that should tell you something climate change is the same they only do enough to keep the voter base happy enough
the problem is human psychology war is an obvious and undeniable crisis with a tangible intelligent external enemy it a kind of conflict that humans have experienced for hundreds of thousands if not millions of years we are psychologically predisposed to come together when facing an external sentient threat like that the same can not be said about a nebulous internal crisis that is mostly self inflicted like climate change there is no external enemy to drive unification in the face of that threat this does mean that it impossible for humanity to unite in the fight against climate change only that it not at all a comparable situation to a war and will be much more difficult to achieve that not to say that war is a bad metaphor though calling it a war could well spur some people to action and to help support the effort since they see the similarities in the two situations i just think that we should be realistic about the prospects
these peaceful refugees are just warming hearts with the fire of diversity they are also fighting climate change by destroying all those greenhouse gas emitting vehicles
basically her qualification is that she a child and does want previous generations to fuck hers over it not that complicated she does have real quals because she a child the fact that she a child indicates how truly stupid the situation has become around the debate of anthropogenic climate change it beyond absurd
seeing as scientists are paid like shit i really doubt this is even a small portion of professional scientists you seem like the kind of person to say evolution is a lie and climate change is a chinese fiction
the intersex society of north america offers a pretty concise answer to the question how common is faq frequency that i think could help shed some light here to answer this question in an uncontroversial way you have to first get everyone to agree on what counts as intersex and also to agree on what should count as strictly male or strictly female that hard to do how small does a penis have to be before it counts as intersex do you count sex chromosome anomalies as intersex if there no apparent external sexual alice dreger explores this question in greater depth in her book hermaphrodites and the medical invention of sex as it turns out the actual scientific definitions for male and female are obvious or plainly inscribed in nature they categories with blurry edges in a given case some doctors might determine a person to be male while others might determine the same person to be intersex or one doctor might determine somebody to be female at one point but then as sex anatomy variations make themselves apparent later in life decide that an intersex classification is more fitting there simply do exist catch all criteria by which everybody in the world can be grouped as m or and the criteria that do exist for determining whether somebody is m or f tends to be political and tends to change in response to political climate at least as much as it does in response to medical breakthroughs male and female are abstractions they categories that we invented to help us describe the natural and social world but now we beginning to find that these particular abstractions do seem to be quite as infallible as we might once have thought them to be i suspect that a different abstraction one that conceptualizes sex and gender as a continuum might be more scientifically rigorous here edit a word
says you know jack about the science behind climate change you just basing your views on dumbed down stuff you hear in the mainstream media or at climate rallies the fact that you be willing to destroy the most important pillars of western civilization just because some doomsayers brainwashed you about how the world is ending right now because cows fart only shows that you have a tyrannical nature and you subject other people to your goals without any remorse or regret which is why people like you should never be allowed near any form of political power climate change is a ticking time bomb and people are too i informed download the actual ipcc report on climate change the most authoritative source on the subject that is on your side read through it and notice that not once they say that man made climate change is proven none of the scientific sources claim that it actually proven it only politics and the media that pretend so and sadly they can fool a ton of people who blindly believe any old bullshit they asked to believe for political reasons
yeah that why they side with the of scientists who claim climate change to be a thing while the gop gives no shit about science
yea i do know why i getting downvoted the storm tonight was hyped all week they never used to have weather alert days or go this nuts fox has the next big thing segment where they try to get people constantly worried about something from snow to tornados to hurricanes the audience needs to be in fear of something on the horizon in the next couple of weeks at all to times so they tune in this the same reason fox has like meteorologists and no real dedicated sports guys they fired rick karle and moved shelton to mid day news while also hiring like additional meteorologists weather is what leads local news ratings in the internet era following any of these guys especially james spann on social media will have you afraid to leave your house for what s just rain i not saying climate change is happening but the move off of cable tv to streaming has these stations panicking
fossil fuels with climate change
excellent you have an explanation for this then on this day in toronto years ago it recorded the most extreme lowest temperature weather event ever for an august c on this day in toronto years ago it recorded the most extreme highest temperature weather event ever for an august c coincident on that day back years ago toronto also recorded another extreme weather event the highest ever precipitation in one day for an august mm climate change what did they do back years ago to save toronto from that extreme weather event for all these years that still stands today as proof of climate change what did they do back years ago that toronto never experienced weather like that again on an august from decades upon decades upon decades upon decades to nay centuries between these moments of proof of climate change or like the stock market is said to do prices will vary depending on current conditions
you mean the people whose job it is to study the climate and propose policy which is based on science and evidence you realize it is the fake tumblr accounts on tia who are actually making climate policy right look i not trying to flame here but it hard not to roll your eyes at this kind of statement given the state of modern conservative climate rhetoric which not only lacks anything resembling a strategy for dealing with climate change but in fact seems to seems to actively deny its existence going as far as to scrub entire noaa webpages on the topic from the internet i sorry but that closer to some dystopian post truth society bullshit than it is good faith engagement on the topic
you have to factor in climate change with winters not being as cold as they use to be and the dnieper river is a large fast moving river i doubt the ice would be thick enough even if it could freeze besides moving troops over a frozen lake or river would be so easy to destroy in this modern age one himar missile would end that real quick sending them all down into a watery grave but you never know russians are not too bright i would doubt they would try it it would be amusing fun for the ukrainians if they did
fair enough i ignored that i do know if there s an easy answer to making these people aware that the mine is as good as thing as they might hope from a job perspective i also do know why buying your kids shoes trumps having a livable climate for your kids it all short sighted but the climate change issue is such a muddy issue from an economic perspective that even without the aggressive proponents and pro advertisement for the mines i do know if there s any easy way to make people believe there s other opportunities and avenues available when there seemingly is how do you change that
do of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming or do of climate experts agree to varying degrees of confidence that humans are a likely contributor to global warming just looking for an honest answer there because i was under the impression that this statistic referred to the latter but you seem to be very clearly representing the statistic as the former and also when we talking about climate change the predominant opinion is that human carbon dioxide production is a the leading contributor how does this number relate to the scientific cause in addition to human responsibility is there a consensus on the carbon based model edit cook video features several politicians quoting the statistic the video includes david cameron saying of scientists the world over have said that climate is urgent is man made and must be addressed does this statistic actually address any of those facts urgency and the need or even ability to address the issue does not seem to play a role this particular statistic so is it intellectually dishonest to portray a political statement like that as being supported by this statistic edit in looking at the actual basis for the statistic it appears as thought the statistic as supported by cook study actually refers to the proportion of scientific abstracts on climate change that were willing to take an opinion on whether or not humans may be a contributing factor to global warming it completely negates the majority of papers which did not draw a conclusion either way
hey man we marching our way to a better environment the more people that start marching the more climate will stay the same and not change so much i marching in place as we speak do your part mister and start marching
climate change is a separate issue what at issue is the truth of what was reported
for whole lifecycle cost nuclear power is too expensive climate change emergency cost of non emitting sources pick one besides hinkley c which is pretty much universally agreed to be excessively priced is still cheaper than current wholesale prices by quite a margin the cost of nuclear is a red herring
nope used to work there they do tell customer service anything besides how to deal with customer service issues they gave an answer that would get them in trouble company decision are based out of their headquarters in amsterdam climate change correlating to basic retail operational procedures is a far stretch sir
i sorry but how is climate change denial a thing in the us money
i neither a creationist or a lobbyist and have yet to see any unbiased proof of anthropogenic global warming anthropogenic climate change or whatever the term du jour is
if it sounded like i was hedging at all then i gave the wrong impression i think my use of really might have made it sound weak as in there was really evidence like kind of but when you look at it really critically or something that definitely not what i meant i meant there really really really was evidence as in reality versus the delusion that i believe some people in the bush administration maybe many managed to convince themselves was true either through cheney once percent doctrine in the case of wmd or almost the exact opposite cognitive bias in the case of climate change but motivated reasoning in either case
in the netherlands there is an event called elfstedentocht an iceskating race between eleven frisian cities totalling to about km it was held in and ever since there has been no other there was either no ice or very thin ice there used to be up to m snow every winter sometimes a bit sometimes very much last time we had any snow was somewhere in or i could be mistaken it took until last winter for any snow to drop literally between then and now there was excactly mm of snow we had flowers popping up in january so do nt tell me that climate change does nt exist do nt tell me abour weak evidence you do nt need to be a scientist all you need is a brain and it seems like some are lacking in that aspect
until there is definitive proof otherwise we are forced to use statistics for a best guess approximation about the world we live in that was just my blanket guess using my understanding of bell curves but i went ahead and found a supporting link a gallup poll in concluded that percent of americans were a little or not at all worried about climate change percent a great deal and percent a fair amount that pretty close to of people who perfectly encapsulate my original point but to be fair i sure the number has since changed as the issue itself has become more extreme if you think that making millions of job obsolete and killing off trillions of dollars worth of business in the name of the environment is not extreme to the people who work those jobs you are sorely mistaken that is the reality for so many of these people and your empathy in that regard is lacking if you ca see how that scares people that are barely getting by as it is oil barons and rich assholes can get fucked but many of them will knowingly abuse this fear to garner support for their anti environmental politics that the problem you trying to shit on millions of honest if uneducated loving working class people who just want to get by i may understand where you coming from but the issue is with my perspective or yours you need to see things from their perspective because there a hell of a lot more of them than just us two their livelihood is on the line and global warming is less of a threat to their day to day than paying rent staying fed etc people have gone to war over less and while many of these people likely most of them will find new work new jobs new money they still gon na be scared so they vote for whatever makes them less scared good people who are too scared or too stupid to know better are the problem is this really their fault of course not or else we would be blaming the jews for getting on those trains all those years ago and that fucked up but they being used nonetheless while they out there doing the best they can and you being manipulated into hating them over the ones who pull the strings i ready for a cleaner world and i know that it does have to be difficult but we fighting some of the most powerful people to ever exist people who would kill you without a second thought just to maintain the status quo and if you do appreciate the extremes that they will go to in order to retain that power then that just ridiculous remember environmental conservation was not a partisan issue in the century both parties in the were making positive steps until the then reagan fucked everything up by making it into an economic issue the hollywood republican president fucked up our bipartisan efforts towards progress sound familiar cut the head off the snake before you roast the damn thing being a moderate is about finding the exact average of a wide set of views on any given topic and then always picking that exact middle point that just being too damn lazy to think for yourself and come up with your own belief if you think the goal is to be perfectly balanced as all things should be then you should grow up and stop basing your political beliefs on a single line from an action movie none of that applies to me i do speak for all centrists but i guarantee you that the majority are looking up to a genocidal supervillain would be far more suitable i more worried about the fact that you would readily assume as much though that not rational and it underlines my point of posting here in the first place centrists are being vilified for all the wrong reasons and by the way educating people on the correct use of a term is not an insult you being taught to hate people and it easier to do that when they perceived as the aggressors i am not do be fooled into thinking otherwise
the meat and potatoes at the forefront of the fight are a number of climate skeptics who have long exploited the imperfections of scientific research statistical margins of error the subjective elements of projective modeling to cast doubt on the conclusive finding that humans have contributed to global warming steven milloy a fervent denier of that scientific consensus was early to play down the coronavirus threat he compared it to the flu an argument that public health officials say dangerously underestimates how deadly the virus is one policy group that has expressed skepticism about climate change the heartland institute pointed to a widely used projection of deaths to attack earlier models predicting up to two million fatalities the critique posted on its website on april ignored the fact that the lower estimate took into account social distancing measures and that the high estimate and others close to it were presented as worst case scenarios if no steps were taken to mitigate the virus spread the death projection was rendered null and void days later when the death toll surpassed that number few of those who tacked from climate skepticism to denialism have any real expertise in tracking pandemics but several are funded by industries that have long sought to question the work of scientists such as big oil companies like exxon mobil and tobacco companies like philip morris they are also backed by conservative groups like the mercer family foundation that hold immense sway inside the trump white house and are deeply invested in the president political future it the same individuals it the same modus operandi the same organizations and the same backers said michael mann who directs the earth system science center at pennsylvania state university right wing conservative interests that are benefiting from the trump presidency obviously want to see a continuation with the trump presidency the lines of attack against the conclusions of health experts are familiar to those who have studied the climate change denial movement which has long relied on what naomi oreskes a science historian at harvard called motivated reasoning it i do like what this implies therefore i going to deny the evidence and i going to question the models and i going to question the motivations of the people who do it dr oreskes said for instance todd starnes a conservative radio host who has likened climate change to the tooth fairy fed the virus truther movement when he argued that the crisis was overstated because he did not see crowds outside the brooklyn hospital center in new york it was the pandemic era equivalent of pointing to a snowstorm as evidence that the planet is not warming days later reporting from inside the hospital found a staff overwhelmed by critical covid cases
whether or not they do we need to find a way to diversify our economy and trade so one nation ca ruin us so effortlessly it clear that industry very understandably lacks the incentive to forgo short term profits in the interest of long term security so as with climate change it going to take government intervention that just not possible there is no diversifying away from america it just not realistic if we made that a long term goal i do think we could accomplish it in twenty years mean while our economy would crumble
do start it up once in a while unless you going to let the engine come up to temperature you do more harm than good starting it for five mins and shutting it off you say you have a battery tender you can hook it to the battery still hooked up in the car unhooked battery in the car or the battery removed and set on a bench or whatever no need for an oil change before storing it getting one after is a better idea set the car up on its subframe front and rear this will keep the tires from getting flat spots fill the tank to reduce the amount of air in it and use a fuel stabilizer intended for storing fuel if you really want to do it right you can buy fogging oil that is sprayed into the spark plug holes bump the engine over with the plugs still out just bump it not even a full rotation is needed fog the cylinders again properly install the plugs and wires and it ready to be started whenever with no worries about the rings or cylinder walls rusting mold can be an issue in the interior depending on where you live and if the garage is climate controlled leaving the windows down a bit to promote air flow can help as can a regular car cover those anti mildew cans sold for closets and such are a bad idea rodents do put baits and traps in the car you just attract rodents dryer sheets moth balls in a container with an open lid peppermint oil other natural herbs that you can look up online or a commercial pest deterrent chemical place any traps or baits in the area but away from the car itself wash and wax it dress the tires check and top off all fluids check tire pressure if it paid off like you said i not sell it park it and if something happens to your ranger you wo be stressing about finding another vehicle
a large issue that people see each individual issue in a vacuum whereas they often lead into each other if you are voting to lower taxes but are against cutting specific social programs to do so you are likely working counter towards your goal of overall lowering taxes with universal healthcare the tax money is a large issue however people fail to recognize that not only does the us spend more per capita on health than the majority of the developed world universal healthcare could still exist while lowering the tax cost for the average person so you end up lowering the bill across the board for most people it just instead of coming out of your paycheck and going to united healthcare it going directly towards healthcare for all in every rational situation universal healthcare benefits the majority of humans or cutting access to after school programs or educational funding you inevitably end up spending that money elsewhere likely through the near immediate rise in something like crime leading to more spending on police and prison or the long term effects of your population being less educated and less competitive in a changing world the same thing with climate change eventually we are going to pay the price of it we already feeling the effects as certain commodities go up when crop yields are lower food costs go up even things like wine will likely increase this year due to a frost in california vineyards reducing yields by half we eventually will have to spend money to salvage fresh water supplies or desalinate water if it even possible to do but to bring it back to healthcare again climate change is detrimental to human health in nearly every capacity but fixing climate change you spend less in the future to reverse the effects if possible and you also be spending less on healthcare most issues are linked together and people segment them off and tackle them one at a time the conservative in the op for whatever reason was against abortion not realizing that all of the things his wife went through happen to other people but also not realizing that abortion better healthcare access to contraceptives std testing sex ed etc are all linked to whatever his end goal is the problem is knowing how much road left you have to kick the can down eventually you have to face the issues you putting off if your single issue is climate change then there are probably a myriad of other issues that you should also care about arguably including abortion since allowing people to voluntarily terminate pregnancies will overall reduce the population in a way that is not genocidal but actually consensual you can not be pro climate reform while also advocating for humans to not be allowed to access abortions you can not be pro climate reform without wanting a population that is more educated you can not be pro climate reform without wanting a population that is healthier and consuming fewer resources to stay that way these things all work in tandem unless of course your idea of climate reform is to fucking kill everyone but at that point it does particularly matter
but you are wrong we are doing nothing all the money is going to global warming the economy how much would it cost to stop climate change it s a staggering trillion to fix the planet temperature how much do you think it will cost to stop plastic from reaching the ocean or stop mismanaging the forests or put some water aqueducts over a canal probably less than a billion far less than what has been spent promoting global warming that does even cover the global warming projects that make things worse what do you think the carbon footprint of a solar cell factory is or a copper strip mine to build windmills or venting natural gas to atmosphere to end fossil fuels
i think it a combination of both prior to his presidency he has made tons of climate change denial comments without an agenda however now he must have national security officials in his ear about climate change threats i do believe he must at least halfway believe the bullshit he spouting but also realizes it pandering to his base at the same time whether it true or not
however osborne office said she did participate in the decision to select makeway as the group to administer funding for the healthy watersheds initiative the decision was taken when the program fell under the ministry of environment and climate change strategy before the ministry of land water and resource stewardship was created in february after taking charge of the new ministry osborne set up a screen with her deputy minister to recuse herself from any decision making involving makeway
does that factor in abrupt climate change
even got a video courtesy of a friend climate change is real guys
i see your point everybody should do their part to combat climate change and we really need to be eating less meat not just for environmental but also for ethical reasons on the other hand it really is the big companies that do most of the pollution i argue it would be much more effective to stop supporting companies like nestle or siemens
except that the train car containers for waste have been tested to be practically indestructible coal ash is more radioactive that nuclear plant waste and has no containment so we already living in a slow chernobyl and the cost of losing a habitable planet to climate change exceeds the cost of building power plants plus the whole point of yucca mountain is to deal with the existing nuclear waste problem of the last years so that you would even bring up the cost of new plants makes no sense as an argument
cheaper in what the cost per kwh is still fairly aggressive for nuclear power and aside from construction dismantling this is a zero carbon energy wo nt comment on water release looks bad but probably the less worse of the options what is the gain to do this given the bad image it is going to give probably they simply run out of other good options interestingly enough they stopped nearly their entire nuclear activity after the incident probably out of panic truth is they realised quickly that they had to restart a fair bit of them starts being annoying when you have no light at home or the subway is not working anymore could we define long term there are some options on the table dig a hole put in there put soil back on top not high tech not particularly satisfying but it works otherwise surgeneration there are some solutions even if renewables are actually cheaper which is not necessarily the case what about the carbon footprint of it a failed nuclear reactor will not bankrupt a country a company sure a country naaaaa the bit on sensitive to major disasters is interesting this is why you usually do not build them in random places and there is some safety features and even with fukushima japan is ok country is still running to my knowledge major disasters in civil nuclear are quite low for the overall amount of reactors built and running this is a bit like the plane a crash is bad but this is still one of the safest mean of transportation and how about the windfarm and solar are going to cope with the inevitable change of climate who says that in years wind will blow the same speed direction and the sky being this clear all year round some of the change we are facing in a few decades will happen independently if we go renewable or not inertia in the system is too big this is too late for that have to have some resilient and previsible way of producing energy
part of thousands of cascading offshoots created for the sole purpose of empowering one group of people over another and justifying genocide yes i agree those are the apparent purposes of the people who start and lead those groups i doubt that would be the purpose of a god but that just me if a perfect being built everything including the building blocks of life and the very laws of physics that this universe is governed by tending to a tiny by comparison to the universe group of smart apes should be difficult to manage i agree objectively speaking nonetheless you ca be sure right now being relatively powerless what you would do with that much power we are relatively powerless right now assuming a god for all we know my or your thoughts as to what we do with supernatural powers could be like a toddler believing if it had the power of his parents he would make life all good by stabbing the psycho his parents bring him to once in a while the one in the white coat that stabs and bleeds him more than he been stabbed to teach that nutjob a lesson he never forget and hopefully let his parents know who boss now instead we have thousands of current and extinct religions clearly thought up by primitive people desperately or opportunisticly making up whatever nonsense they could think of to explain away all of the things outside of their control or power to observe scientifically agreed they are among the most dangerous people on earth perhaps in all of universal history there is no evidence whatsoever that one religion is any more or less right than another yes no objective evidence that is there are claims to subjective evidence and that about all we can say and that does make the claims reliable of course at least not to an objective thinker because there is literally no evidence that any of them are right not to the objective thinker there is i ca speak to anyone else subjective experiences with god the word of god etc except to say objectively speaking there is like a chance they are wrong confused lying ill etc instead we have literally billions of people over the course of human history massacring and eradicating other people from history all because they believed in one prophet over another or disagreed with magic fairy tales humans massacre one another for a lot more reasons than religion any time the chance for power pride or bullying presents itself humans destroy one another we they do this with religion but not only with religion the bully mentality or the presumption of absolute self correctness may be a better description of the mentality rears its head when power and pride becomes available and humans lack necessary self control this happens often in religion especially going by the volume level of a certain subset of all who profess religion the most evangelistic and certain of their own and everyone elses exact status for all eternity it is really a human error that can be found in a lot of easily misunderstood contexts though it can probably be found in most of us at one time or another in our lives and i am the worst offender i know of as far as my limited knowledge of my and others lives and intentions is concerned for instance someone from one political party might say you do see politics the way i do therefore you are wrong or someone from one corporate lobby might say you do see banking regulation like i do therefore you wrong some scientist even highly educated and on the payroll of some soulless corporation might stuff a wad of cash in his pocket and say you do see climate data like i do therefore you wrong i feel like bullies are often attracted to religious thought but not only to religion they are often attracted to power and pride and tricking people about religion can be powerful and create room for pride there are even immature atheists out there that will bully people though maybe even troll theists saying you do understand rationality like i do therefore you wrong about divinity even though we can only speak of probabilities with regards to anything outside of our realm of knowledge and especially as to anything theoretically existing outside of the universe god did do it possibly one understanding of christianity is as progressive revelation revelation to individuals and really to societies as they become more able and willing to accept better ideas kind of like a therapist with a young patient that ca tackle all their problems at once quite yet progressive revelation both societally and individually is believed to be necessary because of how impossibly difficult to reach the human heart or rather entire societies of human hearts was can be through time is god might be doing that god probably is though objectively speaking if we assume god that said it is still a possibility technically speaking people made up a story about it and those people did know a better way a better way to do what and with regards to whatever your answer is do you know a better way to accomplish it now if you think so what the difference between you and them that makes you more able if they did have whatever you have how then have we progressed from then until now purely despite them or are any good qualities of those who came before us even with all their flaws part of the reason we progressed to where we are have we come this far exclusively by ism or have theists also helped make society better since then in whatever way you defining good i for one ca say if they knew a better way than us or not maybe they did maybe did know a better way though deep down but did want to accept practice or rely on it maybe they were just nearly impossible to convince of that better way even if we could go back in time to them knowing what we know now even though our words may be true in that case perhaps even god could tell them everything at that time lest they abuse the power that comes with great knowledge in that case maybe god ca tell us everything right now lest we abuse the power that comes with great knowledge first we have to be convinced to use the power responsibly and what that would mean would be subjective to god if there is a god huge assumption objectively i know then god has the characteristics god has whether we want god to have them or not so it could be difficult to convince us of his omnibenevolent existence until we developed enough to accept those characteristics of his that we might wish were not convincing someone of something is a lot harder than telling someone something for instance right now some scientist may be debating with another scientist about the next possible theorem that explains something about the universe one might know be fully convinced of the answer the other might think the first one is twisting the implications of a previous theorem to come to an irrational conclusion they both might even become convinced the other is twisting things until the most reasonable answer prevails this can all take time because we humans tend to try to remain convinced of what we already know that is what we already convinced of most of us do even like to admit simple mistakes even though we know we are human and most of us dislike fundamental changes to our views of how the world works even more change makes us uncomfortable and many of us avoid it however if progress is necessary change is too so it takes time for us to become convinced that we may need to change it can be very difficult sometimes even seemingly impossible to convince a human being of something even if that something true add in societies of other humans helping one another avoid a truth and all hell can break loose the thing about religion is it can often be understood two ways backwards or forwards this is because it has necessarily had to evolve as humans have and more importantly as society has become willing to accept the changes it needs to make it is a process of slow societal improvement however we are societies of errant beings and we tend to follow those among us not who are the most truthful but who are the most charismatic and authoritative see american politics and really any politics a bully with a bible can treat it like a data dump grab whatever ancient misunderstood stories or rules he wants to rip them out of context or ignore key sections and then basically just use it to scare and control people written communication is especially susceptible to this sort of twisting however i believe this same sort of misunderstanding about god this same sort of refusal to be convinced of something true about god could happen even if god chose to reveal himself physically or even mentally spiritually to everyone in obvious ways instead of using hearsay in scripture it seems like it would be easy to us if we assume a god hypothetically then i believe in reality changing our hearts toward god is probably quite difficult and comes slowly especially with regards to societal change
climate change is religion for the godless
a summary of chapter pitching part the sussexes are displeased the trustees would have control over the money by the end of the meeting the sussexes were shocked the trustees they discovered were neither mates nor servants they were independents who would have complete control of the charity money under the law the sussexes would be denied any privacy over the foundation management for meghan a master of control the legal requirement of transparency was unexpected the foundation legal structure she believed was a deliberate bid to undermine her harry and meghan are even more motivated to leave the uk once meghan discovered that the sussex foundation could not operate in secrecy another reason to stay in britain had disappeared money was critical to her harry was similarly incensed charles had assured him of a major role in the slimmed down monarchy for at least ten years now the discrepancy of treatment between william and himself confirmed the worst he also wanted out meghan was not disappointed by his decision july the sussexes attempt to land deals in la in preparation of their exit the anger fuelling their urgency to leave britain was transmitted to los angeles nick collins was told to start looking for acting roles for meghan her business agent andrew meyer was also asked to look into the possibility of negotiating a mammoth deal similar to the obamas with netflix in parallel she was encouraged by david furnish elton john partner to co operate on an animation series july harry and meghan at the lion king premier in the line up that evening she did not hide her desperation pharrell williams the rapper told her that he was so happy about their marriage and added we cheer you guys on touching his arm meghan smiled thank you they do make it easy minutes later harry was speaking to jon favreau the film director if anyone needs any extra voiceover work he began only to be interrupted by meghan that really why we here she said it the pitch harry praised meghan acting abilities next harry approached robert iger disney chief executive famous for the quip they only root for you in hollywood when your cancer is terminal you do know she does voiceovers the prince asked iger i did not know that replied the executive you seem surprised said harry she really interested sure we love to try said iger grasping that the prince was touting for work that a great idea summer meghan takes no official maternity leave she was counting the weeks until her return to california her spokeswoman said that meghan would not be taking maternity leave because she wanted to prove herself through work yet other than one engagement to promote smart works she undertook no public work during the summer she watched polo and tennis matches and repeatedly flew in private jets for holiday trips with harry and archie they stayed with elton john in st tropez the clooneys in como and in a friend seven bedroomed villa advertised at per week in ibiza vista alegre estate for meghan it seemed taking private jets was like ordering an uber to silence the calls of hypocrisy meghan publicists once again contacted her friends the result was a synchronised chorus of support i am calling on the press said elton john to cease these relentless and untrue assassinations on their character that are spuriously crafted on an almost daily basis jessica mulroney posted on instagram shame on you you racist bullies three years of undeserved hate and abuse it enough actress jameela jamil justified the private jets as protection for the public it not safe for us to be on the same planes they are prime targets for kidnap and sometimes assassination early august harry travelled by private jet and helicopter to the google camp sicily to speak about the climate change crisis his plane was just one of the private jets as well as a fleet of super yachts that had ferried billionaires and celebrities to the festival free from the constraints of palace etiquette harry tasted a movie star freedom alongside leonardo dicaprio tom cruise orlando bloom and singer songwriter harry styles as royals both he and meghan felt entitled to use their status to lecture others every choice harry wrote at the same time on the sussexes instagram page every footprint every action makes a difference like his hosts harry justified his use of private jets to protect my family from these people the identity of these people and the never ending threat harry perceived remained unclear harry holds a press conference in amsterdam to promote the new online eco travel campaign travalyst he was outraged that his audience asked him to justify his use of private jets in reply harry claimed that per cent of his flights were commercial annoyed that his answers were scrutinised harry was encouraged by a hovering sunshine sachs executive to give evasive replies he only flew private he protested to ensure my family is safe in reality at least per cent of his flights were private no one is perfect he then declared i plant trees to offset the carbon print he was pressed to give answers where and how many trees he was asked questions sparked harry sense of persecution whatever he said harry believed was the truth they were special people requiring protection just over one year later heather wong travalyst executive director resigned and was not replaced the cambridges fly commercial meghan refuses to follow them to balmoral the media was summoned to film them flying on a low budget airline from norwich to aberdeen for their summer holidays at balmoral in revenge meghan promptly announced that her family would not after all follow the cambridges to balmoral archie she explained was too young at three months to travel by plane to scotland instead she flew with archie to ibiza later that same week meghan flew on a commercial flight to new york to watch serena williams play in the final of the us open williams was defeated days later meghan and harry flew by private jet to misha nonoo wedding in rome nonoo second husband mike hess was the son of an oil billionaire just the type meghan enjoyed meeting and nonoo admired end of chapter
you are pandering to jaqing off if you engage you pursue the intellectually dubious and fallacious assumption they are engaging in good faith but they do want a debate they have already reached a conclusion and are jaqing off and concern trolling their way into reactions that match this conclusion they can not argue or debate nor do they wish to they have decided trans is bad black is bad women are bad and no amount of rational debate or discussion will turn them from that path i am a graduate too and learned during my first year of my phd how fruitless it is i can present articles with peer reviewed sources from leading academic journals supporting my argument and it is sneered and denigrated and dismissed as fake news anything that does fuel their narrative is leftist or cultural marxism and is ignored even when overwhelming amounts of scientific evidence are presented ie the mental health benefits of supporting trans identities global warming climate change universal living wage etc it is ignored ridiculed and cast out i admire your stance but please do think you can convert these people all we can do is outvote them at this stage
bernie considers climate crisis the most valuable change to national security he opposed the building of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a huge result on the climate bernie bot
the theory i remember is that melting glaciers would slow down the atlantic currents thus reducing the amount of heat they carry up to britain in addition those melting glaciers could also pour a bunch of cold water into the north atlantic and it flows past britain thus cooling it further i believe due to the currents britain is generally warmer than land on the other side of the atlantic at a similar latitude if it is now colder in britain you can say that is evidence that the currents are failing and global climate change is real of course if you wanted to make a real point you should go out there and measure the currents
interesting question but i wonder can we accountable for this since the climate is under gods power perhaps we could also pose the question would you forgive god for letting climate change happen
if you do have an answer or explanation for it blame climate change
nan
if there is no sun we can get rid of air conditioner and ice for our water climate change solved
you will never agree with trump on anything pissing off people that will never work with him just makes them even more combative so me disagreeing with these following statements is my fault and not the fault of the person making the claim it snowed over inches this past weekend in new york city it is still october so much for global warming global warming has been proven to be a canard repeatedly over and over again the left needs a dose of reality in the people were worried about global cooling it never happened now it global warming give me a break interesting studies show that wind farms have a warming effect on the climate let continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories amp manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming china is so happy we ca destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming china is thrilled with us the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make manufacturing non competitive it freezing and snowing in new york we need global warming looks like the will be having the coldest march since global warming anyone they changed the name from global warming to climate change after the term global warming just was working it was too cold uk is freezing through longest amp coldest winter in over years where the global warming it freezing in new york where the hell is global warming snow and freezing weather all over mid section of country global warming specialists better start thinking fast in new york it freezing where the hell is global warming when you need it it freezing outside where the hell is global warming however the people who are willing to work with him will overlook such comments so he has an easy filter to see who willing to work with him and who a hard no which of the statements listed are factual why should anyone comply with these statements why should i overlook these comments
comment content or if not the scientists it the godamn librul politicians fearmongering for votes which is amusing given that extremely right wing politicians in other countries are totally on board with the climate scientists on this the whole hoax thing is purely a us issue as politicians that make republicans look positively centrist have zero issues with man caused climate change viktor orban has no problems with climate change alexander lukashenko the last dictator of europe has signed on to the paris agreement politicians that are significantly more to the right than the gop have accepted man made climate change subreddit askreddit submission title climate change deniers even if you do think climate change is real why the fuck is it such a bad thing to want to clean improve the environment and get better energy sources redditor comment permalink
my point is whether they are big problems or not though climate change definitely is my point is that they are still serious problems that need to be dealt with and we should be trying to solve them as well as poverty
the un made him an official ambassador to climate change even though he has never completed high school
what worse one jet or hundreds of thousands of fossil fuelled power stations government must lead the way in fighting climate change the more miniscule changes the individual does the less pressure there is to make actual meaningful systematic changes
bernie considers climate crisis the most essential change to national security he opposed the establishment of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a huge effect on the climate bernie bot
i have published a paper finding with data and solid methods that doing x is exabercating climate change some guy replied saying basically no that wrong doing x is actually fine since statistical fallacy rather as the director of the institute of abc said we should do you not the director of the institute of abc so your findings must be wrong and there you have a reason for why we achieving f all against climate change not because my irrelevant paper was appreciated but because this is a prevalent mechanism of how public policies come about
biden climate policy wo do shit you must be a fucking mark a retard or a shill his co chair was an oil and gas booster he has big money donors any climate action will be flimsy bs that wo do anything but maybe slightly delay the inevitable meanwhile several of biden informal advisers and confidants on energy policy are veterans of the obama administration all of the above strategy which embraced fossil fuel development and technologies like fracking while publicly trumpeting clean energy commitments these individuals oversaw the bp oil spill and the violent repression of the dakota access pipeline protests a set of tactics which president donald trump is now emulating to put down peaceful demonstrators and then went to work for oil and gas companies or law firms investment companies and think tanks funded by the fossil fuel industry if appointed to key energy and environmental jobs they could pose an existential threat to even the most ambitious climate plans any action that acts to perpetuate republican control is born out of privilege or ignorance of what is at stake for so many people and how desperately people need at least some positive changes lol literally calling people who do vote bloo privileged fuck off poor people overwhelmingly do vote of care about the political process because they know neither party cares about them this was true during the obama admin it will be true during any biden or trump admin biden literally promised nothing would significantly change and now surprise surprise when it almost election time he starts to bullshit about making left concessions he wo you literally just have to look back to the obama years to see this to vote for a party that so outwardly despises any even moderate socdem protpisals and sabotaged the only socdem candidate because you do want to be privileged is so incredibly retarded
should we fix climate change globally
greens ndp and liberals all have plans that would work none are perfect though the greens are anti nuclear and want to increase extraction of the oil sands the dirtest source of oil in the world nor do they have a jobs plan greens are in general anti labour the ndp and liberals targets are nt aggressive enough and the ndp is exactly pro nuclear but their reasons are based in the logistical issues of maintening those facilities rather than the anti science fearmongering of the greens utimately still a pretty poor reason to reject it though and i find it frustrating the ndp will meet paris but the liberals wo nt the price on carbon needs to be about to meet the standard set by the ipcc report the liberals do plan on taking it further than that no where near enough the greens and ndp would both raise it to where it needs to be the ndp plan has the most comprehensive plan followed by the greens and lastly the liberals if liberals would commit to they would have a much better plan and remember it wo cost us anything more because of the rebate program michael chong carbon pricing plan does do a direct rebate but uses the revenues to plan for income tax cuts i personally find this problematic because the amount carbon being polluted will hopefully decrease rapidly over time meaning less revenue it much harder to raise income taxes than it is to phase out green energy rebates on electric vehicles for example the rest of the cpc either do believe in climate change or do nt care because their plan would make things worse
i like the go with my gut strategy very scientific sarcasm aside this is why the guy posts so much about this topic too many people go with their gut about scientific topics instead of looking at the peer reviewed sources i know you are talking about whether he is a shill or not but i using that to make a point i had an extended period of time where all i would post about was climate change it gets so frustrating to see the same false claims brought up time and time again in this case one of the claims that always gets brought up in any monsanto article i ever seen on reddit is that monsanto sues farmers for cross pollination of their seeds which is total bs right when i see that posted i know that the poster has done their research and probably gets their information from biased sources repeatedly seeing misleading information posted can get very frustrating and certain types of people will do what they can to refute these false or misleading claims
it like you saying indoor environments are bad for cannabis although i agree about being able to fully mimic the sun the lack of temp and humidity changes actually helps the genetics and growth of the plant in a perfect outdoor environment where the weather is consistent you might be right but overall there is more control with indoor growing which only helps the plant air exchange is key which is why you vent outside and carbon filter the air intake to your tent for clean air fans in the tent if set up right provide the right amount of air flow to the plants as well flowering outdoors with high humidity will ruin crops and many places like unfortunately deal with that for too long in the summer with the climate change over the last years less bugs to deal with too lol
i a right leaning libertarian i acknowledge of climate change maybe not the catastrophic hyperbolic estimates but i always get called a climate denier because i do want the government to wreck the economy in the name of climate change i really think that the free market maybe with some pushing from the government will come up with real solutions over the next years
you ca take the models which were retroactively changed at the end of last and say they fit what we seen since the early take the projections from the and see how they have compared climate models are not fits to data so your criticism is irrelevant it also wrong the models are constantly evolving but it is trivial to check what exactly the configurations run for are furthermore people often evaluate historical model they compare just fine as do the current ones this is literally the whole point of climate science no it not the fact that you ca separate the basic science from application explains a lot of your behavior here whether or not the planet is warming is an entirely different question than whether or not we should do something about it your economics argument is just absurd hyperbole why do you link to actual analyses of actual proposed policies and evaluate them instead of plucking trillions from your butt the problem is actually a lot simpler here you simply dislike from an ideological perspective the sorts of policies proposed by people that think global warming is a problem but you ca propose any counters or other policies that could accomplish the job of mitigating warming therefore to avoid having to deal with a policy you do like you try to shoot the messenger why bother with a policy if there is no problem in the first place it just wasting peoples time and if we decide that global climate change is a problem you wasting people money too since it will cost orders of magnitude more to mitigate and adapt to climate change three decades from now than it would to start today so yes do offer us a cost benefit analysis
so instead we can have a system dominated by those with the most computing power or largest stakes also there this little thing associated with energy use you might have heard of it called climate change kind of a big deal
if they leave the planet they will die in misery and pain let them it a pipe dream even a degraded climate change ravaged earth is better than a literal dead rock with no atmosphere or life like mars
you are overestimating russian ambitions you are correct though brexit trump iraq iran australia all this is partly russians using divide and conquer the west is weakening actions against climate change are not enough and all of this benefits russia seems like russia will finally get it open sea warm water port
the threat of climate change currently does have any consistent measures additionally nobody is offering reasonable solutions its all just throw money at the government and they make it go away when in reality we need to be funding the thousands of private orginizations with actual plans and systems who are full of greedy beurocrats
lets not forget that the atmosphere does not discriminate released by an suv versus released by a termite every living animal will release with every breath they take on top of this is only of many ghg largest of which is water vapor and the biggest polluter here is the earth water evaporates under sunlight long story short even if every power plant becomes carbon neutral the final impact on temperature would be minuscule it would also be an interesting question that if we do turn to renewal power say hydro whether such change to ecology itself would cause climate change in of itself
bernie considers climate crisis the most timely change to national security he opposed the manufacturing of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a drastic result on the climate bernie bot
biden held a unity panel which included aoc and other progressives to ensure climate was a priority it absolutely will be a priority but in this case his answer is correct the electoral college hinges on a few states pa being one of them i rather get a half assed answer to keep pa and win the election and have a sustainable future than have biden go full green new deal lose pa and the election and them for sure the climate change will be shat on even further by trump and his anti science what is weather and climate burn coal platform greens did make it to most ballots this year trump worse environment guaranteed biden improved environment rejoin paris accords create thousands of new green jobs to replace those in fracking and coal biden bus is headed in the right direction trump is driving us right into a climate inferno literally and figuratively
gee rene you a progressive today just yesterday you were a climate change denier who claimed to be a lone voice espousing my conservative principles r politics
if we let the wealthy have space yachts they going to do an elysium and leave the rest of us to die on the planet from the climate change they caused
r skeptic maybe although it not just limited to debunking the woo found in green movements also note that the skeptical movement is not a climate change skeptic thing try treading rationalwiki too
idk honestly i think that if international politics can keep cool till the election we should be safe from a wwiii climate change sucks but i doubt it will get as bad as quickly as some people are saying on this sub because statistics like the ones relevant to this subject change and predictions can be wrong and if there some sort of planetary collision then there would probably already be news be it through being told directly or through leaks of government secrets if that even something they could hide personally i believe that the world should be fine as long as you and me are here really i only on the sub because i fascinated with the concept rather than thinking there a possibility i interested in apocalyptic scenarios in media such as books television and video games so naturally i gravitated towards this place so short answer no unless someone can provide some compelling rock hard evidence i do think an end of the world scenario is near or even coming for quite a while i may be completely wrong and the sky could part in a blaze of complete chaos tomorrow but i hope this makes you feel at least a little better for now
of course climate change is a contributing factor making the environment drier and more likely to catch fire which is why its important not to bring flames into the equation if no one has a barbecue flick fag ends into the grass leave glass bottles around etc we wo start the fires
left wingers democrat voters definitely have more trust in science democrats also interfere less with government scientists republicans meddled in the work of government scientists studying the epidemic so as to protect trump from embarrassment and placate the anti vaxxers democrats to the best of my knowledge do do this republicans have also shown more skepticism towards climate change and have meddled with the work of government climate scientists all to satisfy fossil fuel donors also i think both sides do really have a distrust of scientists but rather a distrust of politicians ability to legislate based on scientific discoveries certainly not when it comes to vaccinations and with climate change i remember there being plenty of skepticism coming from ordinary conservative americans i seen videos of climate scientists being heckled at public meetings
actually i think a lot of people are ignoring climate change many further generations will hate us for doing what we do
hard to believe someone informed when they spell it in formed i double check your notes the us is getting bigger on uranium it a big part of biden clean energy policy and china has big nuclear ambitions once upon a time we steered away from it but with energy demand growing and climate change worsening many countries are looking to nuclear as a bridge to clean energy
kill all humans solves climate change brings world peace ends racism sexism poverty world hunger the water crisis pretty much all of our problems would instantly disappear
what things in the study of climate change and global warming is there debate about is there some more reasonable controversial topic we can get people interested in instead if people insist on cheerleading i would prefer the two teams are reasonable scientists vs reasonable scientists and not science vs ignorance politics industry
speaking of which why do we still produce soda soda production should be banned in light of climate change
same with my parents church they have been on streaming for couple of weeks at the moment they did it the entire economic area had one confirmed case although before the next church event the country went to banning gatherings over people i am from finland the ompteenth time in the last years that i am grateful of the place i live one of the few areas on the globe that is projected to have positive effect from climate change no earthquakes in the billion old bedrock on top of a hill in one of the safest countries in one of the safest towns and in one of its safest neighborhoods even pandemics seems to take it easy here we did start social distancing quite early and we have a big hospital for lots of rural folks small city big county
i agree that nothing congress does today would stop it tomorrow but the claim that politicians are powerless is pure unadulterated bullshit the only thing that would stop climate change is the behavior of every citizen short of a tyrannical government a government ca forcibly change the behavior of the population true but they sure as fucking shit can set a standard to live by and up to what said is sound congress tomorrow could start the process that would end climate change in years given enough political will the leaders need to lead to set goals to challenge the population to change its behavior and educate people of the impact they make we all know why they do the oil thugs make too much money keeping us addicted but again the claim that politicians are powerless is bullshit if politicians are so fucking inept of power why are they even there in the first place
she believes in climate change a religion in its own right
i just being realistic if we want to do something about this climate change we need to act today other options exist like thermal storage if we electrify our heating charging electric cars if we electrify our transportation and general load shifting and demand response that combined with conventional low carbon sources like hydro and nuclear
in the pilot episode hank threatened to kick dales ass over climate change
as long as climate change is still a problem it relevant billions could end up dying as a result within the next years
wait can you explain how the govt is dealing with climate change i know they are becoming a huge solar power country but in terms of air pollution in places like delhi what are they doin
about climate change avatar director james cameron said people need to wake the f k up we going the wrong direction as fast as possible i like to say that we like thelma and louise we driving straight toward the canyon at miles per hour with the radio cranked up and the top down then i find out this last weekend he flew in his helicopter from wellington to the wairarapa and back again just to have lunch fuck all these hollywood hypocrites
climate change is so much bigger than individuals at this point
so you admit that trump statements about obama and the chinese hoax are not based on factual evidence as for whether climate change is being driven by human sources of climatologists would disagree with your statement vehemently perhaps you should leave the science to scientists and stick to being a trump fan boy
is he also into homeopathy though it hard to take somebody seriously who is that easily fooled not that i do believe that climate change is happening but i question the judgment of people who beleive pseudoscience
these are your opinions or do you actually have sources that substantiate these claims if anything reuters record on climate change reporting indicates that it politically neutral to a fault
i curious on what issue you think that is on what position the canadian conservative party is much further right than the american democratic party on taxes and climate change similar positions on firearms and abortion i do see democrat being further right though
i mean i know but at the same time i guess i more wish i did it always amazing how it the most common sense critique it always really depressing when it paired with the inevitable appeal to authority shout that follows up any answer in a situation where you are not a subject matter expert and i am not when it comes to climate change you should be looking at what the actual experts have to say on the topic
but the answer is not satisfactory it does actually address the issue of what we need to do about climate change at best it a guiding principle in the same manner that do better is a good principle for life he wrote that we should simply reduce greenhouse gases in response to a person genuinely asking for what they can do to stop climate change reduce greenhouse gases is not an appropriate answer i can not just will greenhouse gases to be reduced anymore than i can will climate change to go away answers and solutions mean real tangible policies and actions for example in general i support cap and trade or other policies designed to capture the externalities of carbon emissions this is one part of a potential answer
when energy analyst david fridley and i did a months long deep dive into the opportunities and costs of the energy transition we concluded that scale was the biggest challenge if we assume that energy usage will continue its growth trajectory in nations like the us then there no realistic way through it only if we assume a substantial reduction in energy usage that the project becomes feasible but that requires us to question human behavior and expectations about economic growth heinberg response within this article i inclined to agree with what his analysis points towards there no tackling the issue while maintaining some ideological commitment to market forces the restructuring that will be needed to confront climate change needs to challenge and change the entire structure of modern civilization
i think using the range as a mean which is closer to the end of the scale of data causes the last years to look more red and prior look more blue than had it been compared to the years in the middle of the scale definitely not suggesting the data is inaccurate or that climate change is a thing it is just commenting on the visualisation of the data
please enlighten me on how these facts are crazy did he not fire james comey does he believe in climate change did he do something about erdogan men attacking americans in our capital has he complied with the deadlines for investigations into him edit also do you seriously not see the parallels between the ad hominem strategy and what you are doing right now you wo even acknowledge my points
the things you listed are the alternative to we need to brutally murder billion people if were going to have the planet habitable we have options radically restructure society and make it really uncomfortable to save the planet murder billions of people to keep emissions down that way allow climate change to happen which garuntees the death of basically everyone on the planet
if it is possible to minimize the risks of climate change then the same goes for exaggeration said the letter if minimization is fraud exaggeration is fraud it not about minimization it about deliberatly deceiving the people and their own corporation by denying what they knew it a big difference seriously nobody is talking about prosecuting anyone over the pause in global warming even though we know now it did happen look at the specific conditions of fraud here first
climate change looks like an exponential barks like an exponential and walks like an exponential but it completely possible we looking at it doppelg√§nger sigmoid wiki prudent measures should of course continue to be taken and if we do so we can pretty much drop an inflection point right here right now assuming that we do just export pollution to china that is and for the record xkcd did a hell of a lot better at data representation than that stupid climate variation gif
trickle down economics it just does work it not even accepted by the scientific mainstream of economists it as if some political party were to try to refute a physical fact as obvious as say climate change oh wait
there is a silent majority the set who think climate change driven by humans is not happening are a vocal set a portion of swinging voters who do follow politics closely were scared shitless by tony joe julie and christopher repetition of slogans about crisis and thought that besides it being a real issue we would sooner be doomed if we continued measures that went in the direction of addressing climate change pragmatically
the kkk is and has always been a christian organization do their actions reflect on the vast majority of christians who do engage in hate crimes against non whites that would be the actual parallel argument that the kkk as a protestant organization is covered by others in protestant faiths in the end their protestantism is the inherent issue their interpretation of their duties influenced by cultural factors is so is the case with the small contingent of muslims who belong to terrorist organizations the satmars do reflect on all jews the kkk does not reflect on all christians and isis certainly does not reflect on all muslims edit i want to point out you also strategically falsely represented the scope of islamic terrorist activity you claim that one half of muslims is covering for the other half when it less than of muslims who are in these terrorist organizations this is the same strategy used by climate change deniers who are outweighed but for a long time have demanded a side by side debate platform that gives the false impression of equal validity
a drug fueled nuclear world war iii comes first and not before the us establishes concentration cities for the poor officially so when we hit rock bottom remember an egalitarian post scarcity intergalactic utopia is on its way well if you make it past the drought and famine climate change will bring us
we have these two competing intuitions about generosity i think the first is that helping others is good and the more people you help the more you help the same number of the more good you done the second is that goodness comes from personal sacrifice it less about what you able to achieve than it is about what you willing to give up no big deal we have multiple ways of looking at all kinds of concepts but the trouble comes when you try to compare them who is more good the person who gives up her weekends to be a mentor to one child in her community or the billionaire who donates m to pay for behavioral health services for everyone in the community there no answer they both good and have both done good in different ways with celebrities we come up against this discomfort celebrities are able to have more positive impact in absolute terms than any of us is able to do while still enjoying a quality of life that none of us will experience that seems unfair or wrong when we do good things it costs us it uncomfortable to know that there are people who are able to both do more good and be more selfish who are able to accomplish things we do have the capacity to accomplish and can do so without it costing them anything meaningful but that simply the way it is to pick a different example leonardo dicaprio and al gore really do both have a more meaningful impact on reducing climate change than the average person while also contributing to it more than the average person and all while incurring very little cost to their quality of life
i in oregon and i already fucking tired of the showing ash and orange skies that the area wildfires have brought over my entire local reddit feed is filled with pics and videos of the post apocalyptic wasteland that we all have to look forward to if we do address climate change thank you for letting me rant
stop with the copy pasta please yes this is good news about the progress on nuclear fusion research but according to the people doing the research a reactor which actually generates electricity at a useful scale is still decades away this is pessimism or just not believing enough this is just how it is i do think anyone here does want to see nuclear fusion work we just have to be realistic about it and yes nuclear fission does indeed work well how many hundreds of reactors are running currently how many have already run their entire intended lifespan and more without major incident a grand total of nuclear catastrophes is an acceptably small number how are you defining catastrophe anyway you not just going to the wiki list of nuclear incidents and calling them all catastrophes are you because the number of nuclear incidents that are actually worse than occur in any other industry is very small indeed deepwater horizon cleanup bill says hi that sixty five billion dollars from jusy one incident countingh ow much climate change from oil gas coal working as designed costs nuclear power is safe in spite of a small number of catastrophic incidents in the same way flying is safe in spite of a small number of catastrophic incidents uranium occurs in nature nuclear fission is the reason the core of the planet is hot there even places where madam gaia has accidentally created a nuclear reactor herself without regard to shielding or waste management and life is just fine see oklo natural nuclear reactor and finally uranium and plutonium are not exhaust from nuclear fission they stay in the reactor and then are transferred to a storage container where they stay and they can be processed for reuse nuclear waste is not going to kill you and is not a reason to not use nuclear fission power
it used to be called global warming but after laymen started asking how winters could be getting colder if temperatures were rising global climate change was substituted to avoid confusion it is possible to over simplify climate change is a good catch all for the different ways rising temperatures will affect climate
this is where i say you are ignoring the thousands of studies conducted on climate change the data of which strongly supports the greenhouse effect and link you to a website dispelling the myths of climate change denial i seen the website i been through the whole thing already no less i linked to it a few times this week while i was having this same discussion with people better versed in the science than you no less i see your industrial corruption of science and i raise you a government corruption of science my side of the argument is supported by basic universally acknowledged scientific fact while your side is characterized by hand waving confirmation bias and political scandals happening about once a month at this point carbon dioxide is of the atmosphere has absolutely negligible feedback effects recursive coefficient of about and has little relative capacity for absorption of solar radiation compared to other greenhouse gasses you need a unifying theory so you can understand not only the science in question but since there such a dramatic amount of disinformation in this subject also the sociological forces behind it at least if you too lazy to investigate basic facts like how much solar radiation does carbon dioxide absorb and how much of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide and the same questions with water vapor methane etc i already linked you to sources that thoroughly discredit agw theory with basic facts of chemistry i going to ignore all of your attacks of my character and your irritatingly content less point by point reply to my message and just tell you to look at the links that i already supplied you do a better job figuring out the scientific substance of a debate if you stop looking for excuses to not pay attention to dissenting sources i ask you again how long would you like to wait to act on climate change how large of a consensus do you want your consensus shrinks by the day how many al gore movies does it take to change a lightbulb one just throw it at the box of lightbulbs bam changed
almost every high record temperature was set in the was that man made climate change
bernie will fight for truly universal healthcare no more people dying from lack of insurance he seems to be the only one taking climate change seriously he believes that every child with the grades and the desire should be able to go to college his supreme court and judicial picks will be legendary bernie beats trump
thank you for your question and it a good one the short answer is that to have a stable climate we need to cut emissions to net zero by we i mean every country every state every city and every organization netherlands and other rich countries have an added responsibility to get to net zero before poor countries that because rich countries historical contribution to emissions must be accounted for as poor countries look to get richer as with gilet jaunes protests in france and current protests in chile it not going to be easy to convince people to accept higher costs for doing good for the world but that the problem we must try to solve especially because we have the technologies and the roadmap to avoid catastrophic climate change now it up to each one of us
i wonder how they are coping with climate change
i love reddit i know nothing of programming i think atheists are silly i believe in bigfoot i do believe in ghosts i do believe that ufos are from other planets i believe in intelligent design i believe in evolution and science in general i do think climate change is caused by humans i think string theory is bunk i do believe there was a big bang i am not involved with religion i am a prepper i love weed i love beer and nachos i am canadian
it not fucked though we have a solid years left to stop climate change before we reach the point of no return we are fucked if people have that attitude though not willing to sacrifice their toys to try and do their part
i did and you did answer all my points the points you did answer basically came down to i do believe biden will do those things even then with trump you know for sure that he wo do anything at all and actively make climate change worse
when libertarians contradict themselves its because they are not applying their principles consistently when a leftist or rightist contradicts themselves its because their principles are self contradictory when a libertarian or conservatives are accused of contradiction it because they set up a rigid absolutist framework that unrealistic to uphold when leftists are accused of contradictions it because the conservative is projecting their own moral framework on the leftist without recognizing the complexity and nuance conservatives and libertarians recognize this divide as well only they mischaracterize it as logic emotion so you end up with a lot of michael moore is a hypocrite because he says capitalism has flaws even though he rich al gore is a hypocrite because he says climate change is a problem but he also has a big house feminists are hypocrites because they do want government involvement when it comes to birth control but then they demand government involvement when they get raped etc most of the time conservatives libertarians frame government policy and privatization in terms of quantity rather than quality so they frame the feminist example as should government get involved and see it as a contradiction where as feminists frame it as should women have the right to decide what happens to their bodies and do see it as a contradiction in the michael moore case conservatives see it as should rich people be allowed to exist where as liberals see it as a question the money was earned edit anarcho capitalists are the libertarians that apply their principles consistently anarchy and capitalism are mutually exclusive ideals you can not have private property under anarchy simply because there no way to enforce it my right to swing my nose ends where your nose begins likewise i should have absolute freedom of movement as long as i not touching you just like you should have absolute freedom of movement as long as you not touching me you have no right to restrict my movements if i never agreed to have them restricted ancaps try to get around this by assuming that there an implied consensus where everyone agreed to honor the property lines of everyone else but that no different from a statist assuming that everyone agreed to sign a social contract sometimes they try to use reciprocity as a deterrent if they violate my space then there nothing stopping me from violating there but that assumes that the other person has as much to lose as you do
more surkov tactics of unreality interference patterns to try and destroy all non instrumental reason thinking in the society day after day trump family antics of nonsense and outrage flood the media of society this one is deep seated an inconvenient truth which worked so well in gaslighting the population the gop have adopted the technique of bullshitting and lies for every topic of every kind and the society who ate the climate change denial has learned from the top new techniques of nonsense and lies to win friends and supporters
or we double down on climate change maybe turn antarctica into the only livable zone
the actions we take in response to the crisis will reverberate through our economies our wellbeing and ultimately our life support ecosystem for every action we take we must ask ourselves how does it affect the current crisis who is affected and how today and in what are the implications for the climate crisis what the correlation with the climate in climate change was seen by many as the common enemy of humanity as many see today in the aftermath of the financial crisis decades of progress towards fighting climate change was wiped off as governments around the world felt they had to rescue their national economies industrial production was down so emission targets where met anyway only to shoot up once the economy restarted we ca let this happen again this time this is just a small example of short term actions to solve a problem only make the next problem even bigger the actions that are taken in a time of crisis depend on the ideas floating around this is the time to explore unexplored possibilities but for every action we take we must consider the implications well beyond the next election dates
importance cost of living climate trans rights covid going forward palestine partygate although what partygate represents is another matter engagement partygate cost of living climate change covid going forward trans rights palestine tbh the last two or even three could go either way on engagement
ya but trump said climate change is a myth
the kodaikanal mercury wiki incident is honestly horrific i recommend people read about it but just as an aside not trying to shill here in the last unilever has taken on a new ceo who is extreeemely aggressive about taking climate change seriously like really really pushing initiatives at speeds barely any other company its size is even attempting like becoming renewable powered globally this news news and features feature we now renewable grid electricity becoming carbon positive aka supporting more renewable than they consume by sustainable living reducing environmental impact greenhouse gases how were becoming carbon positive in our halving the greenhouse gas impact of all products across their lifecycles by sustainable living reducing environmental impact greenhouse warning brands that they will be sold if they do adhere to their unilever warns it will sell off brands that hurt the planet or society new unilever chief promises sell off unethical brands bid and then actually selling news brands companies that do have a social purpose there a bunch of others examples but unilever is going kind of crazy in a good way imo with being a forward thinking giant conglomerate so keep that in mind as you consider their past atrocities
we need better education and awareness on soil so people are aware how big a problem it is climate change will affect more moisture to be dropped much earlier in the hadley eli research equable which will causes much more desertification the further north you go from the equator more rainfall early in the cell will lead to more soil loss all over if we also building over perfectly good soil without any future planning or thought about feeding ourselves in the event of a hard time then we might not every get that soil back it can take a questions how long does it take new soil to form and why we should be concerned about losi for proper soil and it layers of soil to be created it not something we can just get back in a few years once we destroyed it
this is the most absurd take i ever heard you think threatening people will sway hearts and minds people who see or go through this are less likely to support environmental change or action these dumb protesters are destroying the climate movement by making environmental action unpopular with ordinary people by threatening their livelyhoods they are essentially holding this man captive and they should be criminaly liable for him missing his meeting with his parole officer i do think that you should be able to run these kinds of protesters over and i believe in the freedom to protest but when you create a clear and present danger to yourself you create a situation which simply can not be legal protesting in the middle of a highway should actually be a crime as it creates a clear and present danger to all of the protesters by which it would be hard to hold any of the people on the road liable i do think they should be arrested but i absolutely believe they should be detained and fined for endangering the public
these fires are nt climate change you simpletons
the difference between neutrality and objectivity in journalism is that the former helps whoever is lying the latter helps whoever is telling the truth the problem is that objectivity means taking a stance neutrality does so even when the media companies do muddy the waters to appease the wishes of their conservative advertisers and owners they will do it so they do seem biased because not giving a voice to a fake degree quack who denies climate change will get them called the liberal media propagandist so just call it even and protect the reactionary snowflakes from the concept of objective scientific facts existing
you did read the article did you they talking about the costs of water quality farm run off etc which has everything to do with white settlement and is one of the largest things affecting the reef today long term you right climate change will get it either way and to address that it cost us another xbn and the rest of the world another but maybe still click the link before going on a tirade next time
ugh bernie it being warm on christmas eve is no more evidence of climate change than snow balls outside the capital building is evidence to the contrary
i also care about climate change but it does make his statement any less true i very much doubt the majority of new zealanders care
from what i understand climate change is going to make more low pressure points and turbulence is going to increase
there are multiple causes the timber shortage is more to do with climate change than covid but everything is exacerbated by the global shutdown
so you think sapience is the defining factor of whether or not the species can survive climate change do you have evidence to back up your claim
climate change will curb the population far more effectively than most think we in for a seriously rude awakening over the next years
same issue as why does tv news give more time to climate change denial than is statistically appropriate more in the us why does tv give loads of qt time and debate time to ukip and not the greens etc etc it all much more a question of what the news media wants to portray than anything meaningful about any culture of people
i imagine their issue is not that cruz simply disagrees with them but that cruz also completely ignores scientific evidence for things nasa studies promotes like the theory of climate change
there has been a pause in global warming for to years depending on who you listen to before you guys call me anti science or a denier or a conspiracy theorist or do a facepalm or whatever just take a look at a few sources that you will find credible the met research news recent pause in warming the news science scientific article has global warming nature news climate change the case of the missing national global warming pause climate
or that they are single issue voters but climate change is not that single issue they may care about climate change but not enough to influence their vote
that not what false equivalency is please do try to call out fallacies as if they are penalties in a game especially when you do understand them you can say one is fact and one is belief and even if i agree with what these children are saying it does change that they are being essentially told these things without knowing their validity or not and repeating them because they are children and you could tell them equals chair and they happily repeat that fact have actual climate scientists talk to politicians this is just gimmicky stage theater
if the worst case scenario is this where all the cost is pushed to the consumer and the consumer can not change where they purchase their product the tax is still going to the government so we can find solace or hope it is being used to better the climate which is great but not too bad
purposeful ignorance and confirmation bias guyo those who live in glass houses should not throw stones there is nothing wrong with building a cool tourist attraction no there not there is however something very wrong with the government directly funding a tourist attraction that is build specifically to further a religious narrative and explicitly deny evolution the vice and ag are far from extreme historically very moderate in reality what exactly do you mean by historically what your standard of comparison there i mean if you taking into account the whole of history hell pol pot was that terrible but that the problem with comparing how things were historically as a broad brush to modern situations anyway let address the assertion that those two are very moderate shall we pence put forth the first bill to defund planned parenthood and has been the figurehead of the struggle to have it shut down ever since he also co sponsored bills to mandate ultrasounds prior to abortion and to re define rape to limit access to abortion in jurisdiction where access is limited he co authored the dubiously named religious freedom restoration act in indiana allowing businesses to discriminate against lgbt people and deny lgbt employees health coverage and invited anti lgbt lobbyists to stand behind him as he signed it into law as governor in he stated before congress that they should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of anti discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities he also said that federal funds should not be given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the hiv virus instead advocated that the government should fund institutions that provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior that is conversion therapy a highly controversial and pseudoscientific measure condemned by the american psychiatric association as unethical additionally pence co sponsored the federal marriage amendment while in congress and called restrictions on same sex marriage god idea as a member of congress pence voted against measures that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation against the lilly ledbetter fair pay act and against the repeal of do ask do tell the american conservative union even hailed him as the most conservative vice presidential nominee the country has seen in years the litany of his religious hyper conservatism above barely scratches the surface as for jefferson beauregard sessions iii let go ahead and point out that the republican controlled senate judiciary committee rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship in for being too extreme in sessions fought to derail the passing of the matthew shepard and james byrd jr hate crimes prevention act asserting at a judiciary committee meeting the same committee which had rejected his nomination years previously that he was not sure women or people with different sexual orientations face that kind of discrimination sessions was also one of just a handful of legislators to oppose the reauthorization and expansion of the violence against women act citing his objections to visas for immigrant women fleeing abusers non discrimination provisions for lgbt survivors and protections for native american survivors in it was sessions who led the opposition to a judiciary committee resolution reiterating the standing principle that the united states would not bar entry into the nation on grounds of religion maybe it because i live in alabama and am hyper aware of the way this part of the country is represented by those who slither forth from here but frankly i find it astounding that anyone with even the remotest knowledge of sessions and his record can unironically assert that he is anything but a religious extremist and a xenophobe to boot climate change has more complexity than you think and there is no default federal stance not that religion is directly tied with the issue anyway thanks for telling me what i think hoss yes it is complex however there is a thoroughly documented and well reasoned consensus that the earth climate has shifted and is doing so at an increasing rate exacerbated in no small part by human activity this comes into direct conflict with the current administration push for expansion of the coal industry de regulation of pollutants weakening of the epa overturning of environmental protection laws and a spate of ecologically harmful actions so expansive i find it difficult to believe you honestly think there is no default stance at play as for the idea that religion and climate change are mutually exclusive well they should be but they are see these are people who believe that if something is directly threatening them at least in the imaginary way that healthcare for women or legal protections for lgbt citizens do then they should just let the almighty handle it as republican representative tim walberg said during an address to his constituents in june of last year as a christian i believe that there is a creator in god who is much bigger than us and i confident that if there a real problem he can take care of it that is why it an issue bill graham was a preacher who given spiritual advice to about every president and mlk alike i got a feeling your quotes are out of context people in positions of power are not exempt from holding deplorable beliefs graham denied his anti semitic stance for decades until the release of nixon tapes let the world hear him say that very quote about the synagogue of satan in his own voice as for the aids quote it came straight from a sermon in columbus oh in the context which you feel i left out is is aids a judgment of god i could not say for sure but i think so literally that he believed aids to be a judgment of god years later he retracted the statement that does negate the fact that he used his platform as one of the most influential public orators of his time to spread that message yes you got a feeling the quotes are out of context i got a feeling too that you inclined to cast aspersion upon everything said here regardless of what mountain of citations i present because it does fit your own narrative religoin sic being present withing sic politics is a stranglhold sic its a reality church and state should be seperated sic but politically active figures should have a need to hide anything to do with religion i do have a problem with political leaders being religious and i do think that them being people of faith constitutes a stranglehold i do believe however that conservative fundamentalist christian institutions and their leaders have a disproportionate influence on the political discourse in america i do think it a coincidence that one of the methods bandied about to discredit bernie sanders as a presidential candidate early in the democratic race of was to use his ardent atheism against him there a huge difference in keeping the state from endorsing one particular faith and shaming its lawmakers for professing a faith i advocating for the former and pretending it the latter is a red herring christians are under prosecution there no war against christianity stop clutching your pearls
what are you talking about if you referring to climate change every scientist in the field agrees that humans have contributed to it the words alarmist and pseudoscience are tools of the right wing and your dear leader trump so do give me that bs
wow this is a lot of audio from very smart people who put a lot of thought into making this audio presentation blair bobier explains how he successfully got instant runoff voting for benton county audience questions after about multi winner methods ratings systems electoral college gerrymandering party organization with stv everything really in november benton county oregon voted to choose county officials by ranked choice voting so too did the entire state of maine where a measure passed to to use the method for election of all state offices speakers kristin eberhard senior researcher at the seattle based sightline institute describes herself as a proud policy wonk she specializes in climate change policy and democracy reform kristin is a graduate of stanford university she holds a law degree and a masters of environmental management from duke university and has taught courses at both stanford and ucla law schools blair bobier is a lawyer author and veteran election reform advocate he has worked on election legislation in both oregon and california and in was a chief petitioner for the successful benton county ranked choice campaign a founder of oregon pacific green party he serves as a benton county planning commissioner and practices law with an emphasis on serving oregonians of modest means
fair enough i biased because i like her and impressed by how young and smart she is i think she had a very very steep learning curve coming from an activist demsoc background and confronting the reality of how politics actually works however i hopeful because she made a very quick turnaround and already shows respect to the left bogeymen pelosi warren and the rest of the establishment tells me that she is a fast learner and tbh although the gnd remains a ridiculous program she re energized the climate change debate and expanded its horizons i think dems do need new energy and bold young people not traumatized by decades of gop abuse if she loses her seat i guess that will be a tough lesson for her but i really think she will be a formidable politician once she fully gets over her growing pains again i really like her so i definitely biased but hopeful
you think he qualified for the health position pretty sure he an anti vaxxer and climate change denier he no likey the science which makes me question his qualifications he may be an awesome neurosurgeon but he proven at hud that he no administrator plus he referred to a popeye chicken as an organization who says i was in a popeye organization
the arguments that i heard include god said the world would never again be destroyed in a flood climate change says there will be flooding around the world therefore it is false god said there will always be seasons therefore this somehow means that seasons will never even change climate changes says that seasons will changes therefore it is false it is prideful to think that man can affect the climate therefore we ca therefore government green programs are just a money grab and we should just complain about the arrogance of man and not worry about taking care of the environment i was also raised in a christian community and i was even aware there was an issue accepting climate change after moving to this new community for my job i was shocked at the response and blind denial lots of people at work talk about critical thinking and proper arguments etc but so clearly fail to follow what they preach when they come to issues like climate change evolution or even social issues they feel that their understanding on a certain issue is the only biblical interpretation and therefore anytime you argue against it you are being unbiblical so they basically just stop listening it can be extremely frustrating
read the content and ask yourself how it differs from the ipcc predictions the degree temperature rises match the effects that will be seen it overly dramatic to underscore the severity of the situation most of the worlds climate scientists agree that it is already too late do take my word for it take the ipccs what needed is a wholesale shift in energy production and usage by industry and agriculture in every nation and it needs to happen right now barring that doing things on a small scale does nothing even if countries decided to do this immediately it not going to have an impact for years the temperature will still rise by at a minimum of degrees by the end of the century and quite possibly by much more small scale changes are like shuffling deck chairs on the titanic when what we really need to do is build a submarine personally i think we should be building underground cities and biosphere like structures that can grow food and mine aquifers for water we already have this technology it will likely be possible to fix the environment eventually but humanity is going to have to ride out the changes for a few centuries in order to get there we already have two examples of runaway greenhouse effects in out own solar system mars and venus we know what happens when the atmosphere of a planet warms up these runaway effects happened without the influence of humans on the atmosphere at all they likely happened over millions of years what we have done as a species is compressed the release of and other greenhouse gasses into a century what would have taken millions of years to release naturally that not going to be fixed by biking to work i applaud the effort and i do mean it to be personally insulting but if humanity is going to survive this we need to apply our efforts to mitigation and not prevention
we will see already are seeing drastic effects of climate change in our lifetimes
i ca say i agree i believe in climate change not that it is man made or anything as drastic as that i just think we should be prepared
how shit ass of a child hood will have them go through a pandemic and war then other global crisis like climate change we could be doing better
if it an issue of climate change then yeah older cars are not super great for it the way they will get this to work is to slow introduce it if it does hurt sales then they will expand it
the money is really fighting climate change it passing money to poorer nations to combat the potential effects of climate change
everyone that says press it to help the climate is hypocritical bc what are you using the one million for unless you donating it all to organizations that will help combat climate change you inevitably be spending that money on things that directly contribute to climate change idc if you press the button but do justify it by saying it helping combat climate change
i think chris harman does a fairly good job of trying together a lot of different theories to provide a suitable explanation in his work a people history of the world essentially he argues that it was internal pressures and dynamics which weakened various civilisations and left them prone to a variety of external threats such as slight climate changes and foreign invasion he actually takes a broader view than most arguing that the bronze age collapse is actually part of a larger trend he terms crises of early civilisation pulling mesoamerican and indus cities into the mix across a much longer period of time the gist of his argument is heavily indebted to vere gordon childe and argues essentially that the various ruling strata of these early civilisation grew ever more exploitative and consumed greater portions of economic surplus he points to the work of kemp old kingdom middle kingdom and second intermediate period in detailing the growing consumption by the egyptian court system and strain on agricultural resources as a chief piece of evidence this in turn drove down living standards of the working population to the point where despite some advances in bronze working many craftsmen and farmers laboured instead with primitive neolithic tools and older techniques were used as last resort plucking wool per what happened in history and lloyd ancient egypt a social history related to this is a dynamic which childe explains claiming that early civilisations went through a lengthy period of stagnation during their peak while great monuments and other signs of civilisation certainly seem grand advancement in science and technology was miniscule compared to the leaps of the early agricultural societies what advances did occur such as in pure mathematics and water wheels were largely by peoples on the periphery of these large civilisations man makes himself the theory provided is that the ruling castes having turned to a strategy of intensifying work for labouring classes had little need for investing time or resources into labour saving technologies bruce trigger for example details the cease in advances made by egypt during the old kingdom period as scribes and bureaucrats came to dominate surplus consumption the rise of egyptian civilization these weakened civilisation were hence more susceptible to those factors mentioned here by others such as invasion and climate change harman also adds intensified social strife to this list of factors using mayan peasant revolts as a key example egypt and mesopotamia are highlighted as odd examples where changes in the ruling layers of society and some development in trading meant that civilisation went through a period of turmoil but then largely got back on track for several centuries more until the collapse came again as the underlying dynamic had not changed although some of this work is getting a bit long in the tooth now and certain archaeological evidence has been disputed to my knowledge no one has ever really overhauled any of childe or harman basic approach or overarching theories
climate change is mainly caused by the high emissions of greenhouse another thing that is affecting this is also the rate of deforestation around the world so there is not enough vegetation to absorb these gases and the problem is worse the seas are also an important factor absorbing greenhouse gases algae and that why the oil spills and generall pollution there is in the sea is so damaging not only for the specific place it affected but globally there a many reasons of the high quantity of extinctions one of them is climate change other is habitat loss due to human activities cattle agriculture expansion of cities mining water air pollution high exploitation of a certain resource needed for a species all that exotic pets market etc most of our economic practices are pretty agressive on the environment and either affect the species directly or their habitat
what nobody had told me when i was in high school was that geographers are the people who are solving the world most critical issues climate change food security homelessness these are all inherently spatial problems i hate that in school geography is where is the equator and what are the capital cities i wish that instead kids are taught how to care about the places they live in and what that means for people and societies anyway i hope that offers some insight
there so much bad stuff going on if i think about too much i have serious anxiety human trafficking police harming black people police harming me women in the middle east animal cruelty capitalism destroying the middle class growing wealth inequality modern day slavery climate change what do i even do with the worry i think all i can do is show empathy i one man i ca change the world but i definitely can be empathetic to struggles their life will be hell for years to come and there not a damn thing i can do about it except spread the word donate and vote and be there for others when they are upset about it so much messed up in the world and i mostly powerless bums me out
vote against climate change conservatives worldwide wo stand for it liberals want to bring it in though take the world back to how it was before gays and climate change honestly i think this is their reasoning
case in point edit and we certainly are going to agree on climate change i believe the supermajority of people who spent their lives dedicated to studying these thing trump downplayed the hell out of covid in the first months we have it totally under control it one person coming in from china and we have it under control it going to be just fine he said it going to disappear one day it like a miracle it will disappear when we have a lot of cases i do look at that as a bad thing the president said i look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better so if we were testing a million people instead of million people we would have far few cases right
one good argument is that with climate change ocean and sea levels will inevitably rise government subsidies should be wasted on homes that will be under water in or years should people be able to live where they want and build homes in these areas absolutely but it not the governments job to subsidize a non forward thinking approach
i think it is totally reasonable to say that you believe in climate change because of the greenhouse effect i do think a detailed understanding of climate models is necessary fundamentally climate change in its most basic form is not a difficult or controversial issue it is equivalent to saying that if you piss in a pool enough the pool water will eventually smell like piss one can argue over how soon this will happen but climate skeptics generally argue essentially that it is simply impossible to make a pool smell like piss by pissing in it they often point to a paper from the that claims that the more you shit in a pool the ranker the water gets therefore you can piss in a pool as much as you want as long as you shit in it also to cover up the piss stench these people are not only not making a critical assessment of science but also not making a critical assessment of scientists they simply believe that actions do not have consequences because that is what they want to believe
if democrats are able to pass legislation in addressing important issues like climate change and health care what stops future republicans from rolling back pieces of those reforms to make them fail similar to their strategy on obamacare do you think corruption reform needs to be the top priority for democrats if they want to make long term sustained progress on these issues
username does check out clintel has high level links with conservative politicians industry and miners source they also seemingly want climate change to happen rather than be in denial of it
plus it about humanity teaming up to stop an existential threat not robots or zombies here but climate change
well i watched the first minutes i sided with the interviewer more than steve as i thought i would if these far right wing movements come to fruition it be a huge blow to human rights it possible we could head towards a lot more war strongly nationalist or jingoistic movements well we had bad luck with them in our past prior to the invention of nuclear weapons if not that more right wing dictatorships augusto pinochet was very right wing and his country had a plethora of human rights violations caravan of death too and he talks about the globalist propaganda breitbart the website is a propaganda website and its propaganda to accuse the bbc of propaganda i go on breitbart it nothing but far right wingers with absurd worldviews correct me if i wrong but take something not political the science and research into human induced climate change it is propaganda namely in this country when certain media outlets attempts to downplay or portray it as a globalist hoax but the beauty of scientific fact especially in regards to climate change is the facts remain true regardless of whether you agree or choose to believe them or not inaction or denial of climate change does not make it go away to me globalist is just another term for jews i go on that stormfront site and the far right wingers are all paranoid about some massive jewish global conspiracy this shit has been going on since the protocols of the elders of zion back in it culminated in a mass extermination of jews in europe which far right wingers now all pretend did nt happen now probably so it increae the chances of it happening again i watch my pbs newshour pbs newshour is a lot like bbc they did a piece on small scale goldmining in sri lanka and the incredibly cruel amount of mercury poisoning it unleashed on the population in the village where the piece took place mercury poisoning is a very cruel disease but there was nt a left wing or right wing bend to the piece perhaps the piece was meant to generate empathy for these horribly crippled humans with mercury poisoning and in that sense as an empathetic person i enjoyed the piece and was also a lot more informed at the end of it you do nt get news pieces like that on breitbart my news is usually bbc or pbs newshour i prefer minimalist partisan spin and just the facts i do nt mind a piece that is meant for me to generate empathy for humans living in very bad living conditions and i believe our media should be held to a high standard if an outlet repeatedly misinforms the public misrepresents the facts or repeatedly violates journalistic ethics in how it conducts spreading its media if it were up to me that media outlet would be shutdown this would help reduce the spread of partisan propaganda in societies
the author is even qualified to be writing on climate his doctorate is in evolutionary biology you think a doctorate in evolutionary biology does not qualifies a person to write about climate science if that is so your view of what is the climate is extremely narrow biological system are major drivers and indicators of the planet climate further more another field of study of the author is organization theory autopoiesis hierarchy emergence complexity knowledge the complex interaction of all the systems in the climate makes this field more relevant to climate change than meteorology paleontology or many other more practical fields his background on organizational knowledge management engineering defence communities of practice community groups documentation and content management product life cycle management gives this person a a unique perspective on how changes in the climate will actually affect our livelihood
the naomi or
talking to friends this is a common thread i hope that the party pulls back from amtrak joe he better than trump but we will lose a lot of potential voters if he is the candidate for me the litmus issue is climate change
i believe the same it was more a play on climate change i believe there is going to be a shortage of protein production and sustainability is key global fisheries are declining and a lot of international aquaculture is very much in danger from disease ocean temperature change plus australia is still very much unpolluted compared to many places in the world
i do get why people are saying that he changing his platform and positions on certain issues not once have i seen anyone just say or understand that he probably lying the gun lobbies understand that if people are actually buying his sudden change to try and bring in centrist voters in he could even get his party to acknowledge climate change look at conservative provincial governments doing anything to appease to their right wing base he won his leadership position by appealing to to the right wing base
the point is there has and will always be climate change and the world government is exploiting it to obtain compliance from the majority of people who can not logically think for themselves typically these individuals are referred to as liberals democratic socialists communists or just plain dumb asses
that cartoon is based mostly on modeled smoothed out data and the solid line represents real data this is the problem with the internet you want easy answers to complicated problems using your brain is hard i understand no one is disputing that humans have an impact on climate change the catastrophic events that some scientists predict are based on huge assumptions and models fit with if not parameters the model is constantly adjusted and many of the models if not all have been largely off and could not predict the climate we have observed this recent cooling so saying scientists understand climate change is like saying cats understand how their cat food is made you would need to spend of hours reading scientific publications to have a shot at saying something intelligent online about the issue all the standard climate change talking points people list are just politicians and media pandering to people who are too lazy to use their own brain
i understand it econ degree you can interpret many things in science you ca interpret numbers that do exist let me be clear there is no identifiable base for studying climate change over centuries and there wo be for more years
for brassier nihilism is the philosophical response to problems like climate change unlike someone like nietzsche brassier is not trying to avoid nihilism
treated this pandemic like they did climate change ignored it and manipulated until it got out of hand then threw up their hands
how are we going to stop the climate change when we ca stop killing each other
oh biden is horrible a senile very likely rapist with a political track record that would make a grand wizard proud a neoliberal puppet propped up by the dnc a status quo candidate for middle class suburban white americans yet there not doubt trump will do a lot of irreparable damage and is magnitudes worse i hope biden wins there are more important things like climate change we can not waste four more years on also i want to watch the meltdowns of all right wing media figures if trump loses
climate change is a myth transjenderists are mentally ill i see universal health care over my dead body yes mr anderson whatever you say just please make sure you finish all your applesauce
good thing climate change is a chinese hoax or we all be in big trouble and might have to do something about it
i cool with him not being forthcoming on any particular stances talk less smile more shake hands with him charm her etc sorry that scene from hamilton could basically be about him but in all seriousness being committed to action on health care climate change etc but vague on specifics means progressives can feel comfortable voting for him but he does have to answer awkward questions about making the airline or insurance industry go out of business and at least right now i think the vagueness means he open to lots of different ideas which is good
i really tired and i read that as climate change will destroy whale societies that sounds pretty crummy but not as bad as like destroying the south western us
what is the logic of banning transgender individuals from the military i can see the argument to not pay for their related medical procedures but why not let them serve and why announce it over twitter without even consulting the pentagon or letting the armed forces know that policy decision was coming it does seem logical to me at all honestly your anti science argument is borderline conspiracy theory who is conducting a massive power grab by supporting environmental regulations the millions of average citizens with access to cleaner water the solar industry the illicit polar bear pelt cartels the secret alien council controlling every country on the world that signed the paris agreement it seems like you value logic so why do you think almost the entire scientific body got the question of climate change wrong i would actually wholeheartedly agree with you that private sector experience is often a benefit however an ignorance to workings of the public sector is never a benefit so do you think that an inexperience in the workings of government is a necessary evil when you have a president so ingrained in the private sector but one final thing and i genuinely curious about this what mess did obama get us into i get that not everything is ideal but overall it pretty good the economy is good thanks to the legacy of obama policies isis is losing ground at the hand of policies obama first implemented and cooperation between the us and our allies was excellent until just a few months ago i just wanted to hear your side
pretty sure all of government flies private let hold them accountable for climate change bunch of dickbags
but i do have to wonder what it says about us that a teenager can gain traction on this topic but adults apparently ca despite talking about it for decades longer than she been alive because greta represents us the generation who will bear the brunt of climate change greta also speaks the truth in an unfiltered way again something that is a direct mirror of how millenials and younger speak and think of climate change she is not some celebrity advocate who goes to some fundraisers and then goes back to her cushy carbon filthy lifestyle like say dicaprio or gore and unlike scientists who try to keep a level head speak factually and impassionately she speaks from the heart we feel her anger the reason why greta resonated where adults failed is very very easy to understand if you bear in mind that her supporters and the people she inspired are millenials and gen i reserve judgement about her long term effectiveness but right now i not seeing any concrete changes being made let alone as a result of greta personally greta has no power herself she is just a girl she has however been the catalyst of massive youth led protests all over the world the likes of which have never been seen before the fact that politicians do not care just shows how broken beyond repair the systems of political accountability are it has no say about greta work she is the world greatest and most impactful climate advocate but fixing climate change is an issue that goes beyond policy within a country it requires leaders of every country to sit down with a willingness to make radical changes including the us china india australia and other developing countries all these are actors with a vested interest in not doing the things necessary to cutback emissions because their economies depend on these bad practices climate change will never be fixed because the short term effect are going to be disastrous for many countries and therefore cost a lot of political capital for decades and years to come and the people who run the political establishment and at least half of all voters are fucking boomers they are short sighted because their lifespan will not overlap with the worst of climate change and even though they do say it out loud deep down they know it and they count on it
recycling corporations are wasting millions of tons of resources and severely damaging the environment kurzgesact has a really good video on this but to summarize corporations have successfully shoved the climate change problem onto consumers edit wow this blew up so to elaborate this problem is quite that black and white the amount of waste varies a lot between countries as well as the providences states within countries
screw that event and whatever debate coming up i am talking about last tuesday debate and i was not satisfied with the level of questions that pro trump debate had there should have been questions on climate change cnn was shifting the democratic debate from a political event to reality television and those hosts have a clear conflict of interest and should be nowhere near the space between politicians and the public
i be amazed if any of these people could even be able to navigate the internet to a scientific study this information is not hard to find either they truly have no idea how stupid and ridiculous these types of claims are with the mountains of evidence we have for global warming climate change
what with all the climate change talk we should use propane and propane accessories to help our energy needs instead of this oil or charcoal
most leftist critiques of liberals seem to be directed at people who vote d in elections but otherwise are into politics not at people who are center left and actually into politics i have seen a single person here say that do want healthcare expanded greatly or a single person who likes how the criminal justice system is as is or a single person who says climate change should be tackled immediately ultimately that what got me into this space realizing that none of the awful shit my friends said about center left democrats or neoliberals is true but most of the shit you guys say about leftists i seen countless times first hand
so i guess no one can answer the question as to how vacations to europe are combatting climate change
do you trust nasa they have a long list of organizations that say it better than i can and they cite factual objective studies that anthropogenic climate change is a different viewpoint it has measurable evidence and proof
thucydides melian dialog in action the usa is the world biggest oil producer and the pentagon is the world largest consumer of oil products so the strong do what they will and the weak suffer what they must it coud not possibly be clearer that there will be no action by the us on real climate change policy and that trump was supported by big money because of this trump presidency has one actual climate change goal destroy government science on climate if there is no official climate science then lawsuits against big oil for damage to the planet can not ever be validated protesters can protest but a large section of the public has a very short attention span and no actual desire to do anything about the problem baby boomers love their harleys and their big ass trucks dumb fucks that they are the boomers are like geese they consume everything in front of them and shit on everything behind them ai nothing gon na change till they are all dead
that has been incredibly informative and insightful i greatly appreciate it i could say much about the operation that went on at my grandmothers farm i was a bit too young to really ask those kinds of questions thanks i glad i making at least a bit of sense i been spending quite a bit of time researching this subject lately i only take issue with this last statement i think since we have domesticated many of these animals to the point that they can no longer survive without us it is now our moral imperative to ensure their survival we obligated to care for animals that already exist but we under no ethical obligation to tend to a breed species that we created if we discover that the breed species is harmful to the planet in fact ethically it quite the opposite for instance in order to prevent further harm to many climate change food and water crises etc we would be much better off without large domesticated land mammals a species does know nor care when it goes extinct extinction only matters when other beings relied on the extinct species for survival and no one relies on cows or sheep for survival they may not be necessary in some parts of farming but they can not go ignored since they have many uses when it comes to agriculture and they have high cultural importance in many countries animals are unnecessary to grow food look up vegan organic farming and perhaps seek out the book growing green the largest csa community supported agriculture in the us is a farm in new jersey with nearly subscribers they use no animal inputs at all manure may not be necessary but it is a great option and in a world undergoing incredibly fast transformation more options is what is needed because the best solution can not always be distributed worldwide that true but i arguing for the best option for people who have the ability to choose it showing that other people may not be able to do it simply goes back to my point about making up for what other people ca or wo do my point is that giving up animal products is easy and any environmentalist who thinks they doing the best they can without becoming at least close to vegan is kidding themselves
the earth can who stand climate change the people living on it ca
bump up the min wage of employees to hour slowly rise the price of the food to cover the increased wages while also slowly shrinking meal sizes over the next couple of years to reduce the amount of shit people eat also invest into fake meats such a plant based or genetically grown meats install solar panels and turn the company green in preparation for effects of climate change can also start selling fake meats in supermarkets
comments for comments yes do give a damn about upvotes i just call out man made climate change as bull shit then listen to all the ranting comments i get back and laugh cheap fun hehe
these shady fucks keep trying to get the fed to bankroll a climate change hall of justice
i used to be a science teacher and me being that mad scientist that i am i did a few things that some people might consider cool my favourite one was a demonstration gone wrong with some white phosphorous white phosphorous spontaneously ignites at about or so degrees and the climate at the time was about those temperatures so i tell my year class that the phosphorous should ignite once it is out of the liquid lied even after waving it around like a maniac i had no burning phosphorous so i tell the kids that it may have not ignited due to a dirty top layer and proceed to cut a fresh surface that was a mistake as soon as the scalpel started carting whoosh smoke and flames everywhere i was enjoying myself and waving the phosphorous around and showing the kids how it burns and lets off white smoke about the time that the fire alarms start going off i decide i should put my serious face on and kill the reaction before evacuating while we wait for the fieries i was popular with the head of science but the kids were nervously excited coming into my class for the rest of term a couple of the other cool things i have done with students butanoic acid smells really bad from butyl alcohol smells bad whilst using a student volunteer they learn about how a change in functional group can affect smells as well as demonstrating oxidation reactions glowing pickle experiment sticking two nails into the pickle and hooking the nails into the mains power and hitting go the outcome is rather cool and can be seen on this youtube link but i did learn that if you accidently touch the nails together in the pickle you get the nails welded together and sparks flying i have a few others that used to keep the kids interested in how i would try to burn the lab down each week mad scientist teacher tried to burn the building down with phosphorous not recommended at home made pickles glow with electricity not recommended at home and made bad smelling chemicals also not recommended at home

how is saying climate change deniers should be shot not inciting violence exactly
search for and you will see the references to the imminent solar minimum it is not the focus of the article which covers the whole study methodology etc i posted the nature article because it is comprehensive and explains why here are some more focused articles two years ago nasa started covering their ass despite their political investment in global warming zarkova findings were first reported in at first the politically skewed scientific community ignored her and called her a climate change denier she pointed out that she was a mathematician and had no stake in climate change to little avail so far the predictions of the study have been spot on and it is now being peer reviewed seriously and rhetoric politically has changed from global warming to climate change there is a bit of denial going on if you are clever and can predict what would happen there is some serious opportunity to make wise decisions that bet on bad weather while institutionally everyone is still in a global warming kick for investments policies and allocations
so are you saying we ca stop climate change because we not all christian or because christians are all nice
climate change
trump opposition to climate change action alone makes him the worst president in the history of usa compared to the millions of deaths he has caused by that everything else is basically just petty crime
for far northern countries like canada climate change will come with certain objective benefits for the humans living here such as warmer winters longer growing seasons a navigable northwest passage etc this is not to say climate change is a threat to the world but it will not effect countries equally across the globe
skiing faces challenges due to how climate change is effecting snow fall in certain areas is an honest assessment calling skiing an endangered sport is propaganda
lol like hating abortion or freedom from religion also denying climate change
no problem happy to spread awareness of him yes that presentation is an eye opener we in the age of neoliberal science right he described right now he can read the future a bit that man he has a tendency to go stream of consciousness style with idiosyncratic vocabulary in his books but aside from that he really good he barely said anything during covid times and i seriously hoping he does actually see what happening and he going to return soon with a good analysis he one of the few people on the left i still want to read and listen to you might find the thirteen commandments of neoliberalism interesting link below i find he describes the psychology of our elites and culture very well i sure you met neoliberals in your everyday life everyday neoliberalism he calls it it a terrifying culture the chapter on climate change in never let a serious crisis go to waste is also really good
climate change brings extreme weather like heat waves that are already killing people
we do agree on evolution climate change or masks how do you expect industry to cooperate when basic science is ignored
that just a stereotype there are racist people all over the world my point is that this blanket statement achieves nothing it like tweeting out climate change is real no one is going to have their mind changed over a statement that has been made and debated for decades unless you are adding something meaningful to it otherwise you are just doing intellectual masturbation
humans can get fucked we deserve climate change
the president and a large portion of his party are climate change deniers stop pretending that it a niche conspiracy group
first flood control is not the city responsibility most of the flooding occurred outside the city limits the state of texas and the county has primary responsibility for flood control when we looking to respond to a disaster the first lesson we learn is what was done wrong and if necessary how do we replace the people who failed to prepare us for the disaster before we start implementing fixes we need to get rid of the people who got us in this mess in the first place ed emmett is at the top of my list in office since he has consistently denied climate change and advocated for tax cuts while wasting county revenues on things like his stupid astrodome fetish he clearly not interested in doing his job so he should be fired steve raddick is also a long time commisssioner also has failed to act and his precinct is the part of the county that received the worst flooding so that was a big fuck you to his voters if this were japan he would committed ritual suicide for failing so badly but in american you fail up either way we need to purge current officials from office they not competent they are corrupt to the point that they ca serve the public most basic interests i not advocating for any particular party just saying throw the bums out maximize the capacity of the draining system despite what some reactionaries will tell you three year storms in three years is not a once in a lifetime event it indicative of a massive shift in the kind of weather patterns we can expect in the houston area we need to make sure that the drainage system is up to the task the corps of engineers is already engaged in a project to widen the bayous but a flood control tunnel is in order at least one ideally three to link each reservoir to the bay this will give overflow capacity so that the ordered release flooding will be much less necessary in the future link the reservoirs the reservoirs should be directly connected to permit water to flow from one to the other precipitation will very rarely be uniformly distributed over the watershed so linking the reservoirs allows us to use the current storage system to be used as efficiently as possible longest term meyerland has got to go it floods every single year and has for as long as i lived in houston buildings in meyerland are built with flood response infrastructure pre emptively this is a sure sign that this is not a place that people should be living the county state and federal government should develop a long term plan for future reservoir placement this plan should include setting aside the billions over decades so really only tens of millions necessary to purchase homes condemn them and build reservoir space the meyerland area is far too flood prone to be populated if we make it clear that the year plan is for it to become lake meyerland the cost can be minimized and we can make installment payments on the project rather than borrowing a huge amount of money all at once
aye they a pretty expansive species and climate change has caused them to be seen in places like hungary northern france etc whereas in the past their range was closer to the mediterranean one of our experts might be interested to know exactly where it was found though is that a city you listed edit nope my german geography is up to snuff consider listing city just in case a mod wants to know
the long term increase in average temperature and the higher frequency of out of the ordinary events including natural disasters are absolutely suggestive but the whole look degrees in summer climate change wow australia is burning climate change heat wave in europe climate change there no snow for christmas in norway climate change and many other similar isolated cases are giving people who post content refuting climate change ammunition because it really easy to find some old case of those things happening and thus fallaciously claim that the climate has changed at all or that it part of a natural cycle and nothing we do affects the weather
to quote said poster i wonder whether it will become acceptable to say in public that yes climate change is real and it will kill people but those will be poorer people in distant parts of the world so why should i care this was the initial post they made later on they made the below why is it so controversial to point out that while people may say they care about people half way round the world their actions rarely mirror their words i find it unlikely the poster was aiming to argue for the actual position of fuck all got mine but rather arguing that this is a common position for people under pressure i myself made the argument in real life not on the internet that we liable to end up shooting refugees if climate change makes things bad enough this does mean i advocate shooting refugees rather swift and strong action on climate change but i certainly understand that it could happen
climate change well if it is real it will be when i flying to the corner shop
gun safety should be taught gun safety may help prevent firearm accidents and i am all for it while we at it we also need to teach kids that evolution is real withoutany religious bullshit about folks and climate change teaching about people will help some people find out who they are and would hopefully decrease the massive amount of violence some individuals face
science failed to predict flood and heat intensity scientists want a super computer powerful enough to predict the damaging news science in my theory global warming arises from heating earth crust and ocean water with dark matter pervading occasionally solar system r r r comments bqnqnf r comments r comments r comments jskvfb r comments the carbon dioxide levels are thus only minor driver of climatic changes rather consequence than cause and global warming can much faster than greenhouse model allows the conservative circles were traditional dismissers of global warming in general whereas progressivist scientists established itself as an alarmists but i soon realized that problem of progressives can become exactly opposite the escalation of global warming symptoms can be much faster and violent than their own models predict but the progressivist science reacts to observational paradoxes in its typical consumerist way rather than thinking about more advanced explanations they simply calling give us more money under such a situation the further investments into research become perverse wiki we are rewarding scientists for doing biased and short sighted work in essence not to say that computer models are descriptively blind gigo garbage in garbage wiki approach as they can not invent more logics than its inserted during their programming as one meteorologist once said to me more powerful computers just help you get the wrong answer faster no computer model can invent dark matter effects or whatever else cause of global warming by itself in this way formal models just contribute to perpetuation of blunders in science scientists have to work smarter not essays stupidity of see also what climate scientists are saying about this catastrophic summer the community has done as good of a job projecting how bad climate impacts would be at degrees celsius one scientist said scientists are scrambling to figure out why models are becoming more devastating and r scienceuncensored comments hkcher new climate models with high climate sensitivity are r scienceuncensored comments carbon in atmosphere is rising even as emissions r scienceuncensored comments what if we stopped pretending the climate apocalypse can be culture cultural comment what if we stopped pretending our seas are capturing more carbon than r scienceuncensored comments why do conservatives believe in climate r scienceuncensored comments
climate change might make large parts of the southern hemisphere hard to live in especially with such a large population for example parts of india are already running out of water which would be a problem if their population was half of what it is what do you think happens when a large portion of india or africa become inhabitable the resource scarcity will lead to a massive amount of bloodshed and migration both climate change and overpopulation play a role there are already measures to curb climate change but there are no measures to stop population growth in places that still have kids on average when they get fucked in the future it will be their own fault
i guess my first instinct after reading this is to validate your feelings it understandable that you are feeling how you do particularly if you are in an area that has been directly affected by climate change i feel like our culture tells us it not ever ok to feel anxious or depressed but there are some situations that will evoke those feelings in healthy individuals who are in touch with their feelings climate change is a daunting and difficult situation and it makes sense that people are feeling uneasy about it self care helps me a lot when i am stressed anxious about situations over which i have little control that can look like different things for different people i try to do things that make me feel calm and safe when i am anxious for one i think even starting this discussion around mental health issues related to climate change is pretty powerful because reaching out to get support is a fantastic way to care for yourself i do know if any of this helps but these are my most of all remember you are not alone
ok so we have them finally acknowledging climate change is happening and is man made with how hard you have to drag them kicking and screaming into absorbing new information it only took us three decades i see this as a win a very very sad win
yes we must blame the government for not doing enough about climate change whilst we the people buy blood diamonds buy electronics made with rare minerals from the congo and other conflict ridden african nations have lifestyles of enormously excessive consumption waste a shit load of food every year sit there glued to the tv listening to a bunch of talking heads while we destroy our own environment bit by bit each day its some good fucking irony we are too addicted to our lifestyles to admit what is clearly all of our fault
i lived in phoenix my whole life and i often find myself driving around the city and just thinking to myself that this place should exist it a monument to mans hubris i looking to moving north myself the entire southwest is going to be hit incredibly hard by climate change we already living on borrowed time and dwindling resources
it wo and we suffer for it climate change is going to be devastating to global society and you not going to be immune to the fallout
well we are yet to see if there is an actual positive effect of emotional investment in politics because emotional investment is as far as of people go i mean republicans are disgusting but dems could have codified roe vs wade joe manchin actively ensures we will all die from climate change and pelosi is trading stocks at the end of the day they all eventually sit under same dining table called robbing populace of its riches and future us just found out that creating virtual parties and splitting the hate and juggling it like a hot potato keeps the sheep in stables i think these guys had a good laugh when people started defending one scoundrel over another
the is likely not referring to mere climate change they likely referring to anthropomorphic global warming theory in which case it best they do allow skeptics in though the reason for this is that any real questioning of anthropomorphic global warming theory quickly undermines it you right that skeptics should be disallowed but only if the aim is to ensure that the scam can continue personally i love to see skeptics in there i love watching the self appointed rulers get taken down a peg
well this is a case similar to do ask do tell where the military policy is not matching up with the medical science the funny thing is the military gets it right on climate change as a national defense issue whereas our politicians on one side of the spectrum mostly do
taxing the rich eliminating student loan debt and making higher education available to everyone his position on climate change and how is truly is a major issue he is for a living wage for workers he wants to eliminate for profit prisons and end the war on drugs my god there is just so much here is a link to his stances if you wish to see more but those are a few that really stand out to me link
we can control it why do you think planting trees became a thing you are thinking of it like a light switch yes we ca nt just turn the air conditioner on for an hour sure but we have these movements going on to enact climate change we have the power its just over time and not a button push we need to cut back on emissions and increase tree effect to remove emission that is climate control
donald build the wall trump is pro immigration donald they rapists trump is pro immigration donald shithole countries trump is pro immigration he wants to pull out of nato and the un the biggest globalist organizations are you a retard i really ca tell how someone can think trump is pro immigration and a globalist without being a retard here are a few climate change denier tweets from trump before he had to rally supporters it late in july and it is really cold outside in new york where the hell is global warming we need some fast it now climate realdonaldtrump another freezing day in the spring what is going on with global warming good move changing the name to climate change realdonaldtrump the weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming hoaxsters were forced to change the name to climate change to keep realdonaldtrump he has over tweets before denying climate change so keep lying to yourself that trump does really care about climate change
as a person who has never came during sex do take his inability to climate as something that is wrong with you there is nothing wrong with you nor do you need to change yourself this may be a physiological problem that he or you ca control the point of sex is to have fun and enjoy each other it ok if it does always end in an orgasm but if this is something that is important to you then a conversation is needed i have been with both sexes and it made me feel like something was wrong with me because i could orgasm for other people pleasure and because it was so difficult for me i brushed it off and decided enjoying sex was more important it took me a while to analyze my feelings about it so keep that in mind when talking to him just be honest about how you feel there is really a right or wrong person in this situation it more of a compatibility issue i hope this helps
she really believed in climate change that beyond surprising
all accessible sources of fossile fuels are depleted overexploited fully developed or sought after aggressively by governments and billion dollar corporations with all resources available if you going to buy existing oil fields and decomission them you need to pay more than what the current owners expect to make from what the entire reserve is worth if you find unexploited reserves you have to invest billions simply in exploring and then pray that what you find is in international waters disputed areas warzones or autocratic states and even if you find an oil field in a safe place that lets you control it and can afford to pay it it wo be enought to make a difference all major companies and governments have already projected their ghg emissions based on existing reserves and we already know those predictions lead to catastrophic climate change and that assuming your government does invoke eminent domain laws and take it anyway you be better of focusing on carbon capture or renewables this simply is an option
why are we talking about climate change
itt people who do have a clue what the paris agreement actually did tpp of climate change honestly read the fucking thing it goals are unreachable its non binding even if you agree to it and literally no one is paying the a year to help developed nations switch from fossil fuels to renewables india is part of this agreement and they will be increasing their emissions significantly through the paris agreement is a shitshow and at the very least should be binding otherwise this is pretty much just a huge pinky promise by everyone participating
i think his son james is very switched on to climate change have a vague memory of reading about him going ape at some of his father employees a few weeks back about it
not sure about the head up arse thing in particular basically the denial of climate change of which we contribute considerably to
i agree nuclear should of been a part for years i m not sure it stacks up economically though from what i ve read it requires a carbon price to be inline i mean i think their should be a direct price on carbon so that s fine i m also for nuclear for the simple reason it will shut a lot of people up i m willing to pay more for power within reason if we can actually do something for climate change
let me his main concern is people not cheering loudly enough for climate change action now
instances that come to mind fairly easily are natural disasters not too contrived that you might need to break the speed limit to get away from wildfires or tornados climate change makes these events more likely so the situation is too outlandish
i know he gets a lot of hate but bil to combat climate change is a step in the right direction
do see how this is an issue climate change increasing droughts floods depending on where you are more wildfires more hurricanes more flooding in low lying areas and more temperature extremes including heatwaves but also going the other direction are not an issue the resulting potential for political instability is not an issue the earth a big rock it going to survive just fine the concern is around keeping it habitable so humanity can survive long term effects are worst already being felt at the equator it just taking longer for the us to start feeling it there a reason the un makes a big deal of this and this comes from someone who kinda hates environmental hippy groups for not understanding the science behind things and misleading people as a result also you can put stuff that is dirty in the back that true trucks are great for hauling dirt and couches because height is an issue and they can stick out the back but on the contrary if you carrying luggage for a vacation and it raining either your stuff gets soaked or you put it in the cramped cab meanwhile the trunk of my wagon is fairly sizable for this stuff and i can lock it when i carry bikes i throw down a few ratty blankets you gain a few things but you also loose a few things i question how many truck owners actually use those capabilities there like one time a year a truck comes in handy for me so i borrow one then
why is the debate over whether or not something is a problem so terrible it is that how all solutions start you first identify a problem then you settle on a solution then you implement the solution then you measure its success the problem is that we can not get past the first step we are stuck in an endless meaningless debate that is really a debate so much as a deliberate attempt to stall progress that prevents us from moving on to the rest of the process you approaching it from the same angle as the other guy listen our side knows better what the real issues are in our society so if you would just accept that we could move forward but we really do we really really do many of us have dedicated our lives or large portions of them to identifying these problems the fact that you believe that the debate is still justified is evidence that the tactic has worked you been convinced that more debate is required meanwhile every day that passes makes the problem even harder to address i not a conservative but i do understand many of their views we all understand conservative views no one is confused as to what conservatives believe but those views are incorrect they do not reflect reality and you want to decide for me what i should feel about different issues going on out there right now you talking about society wide issues of course we want to decide for a segment of the population we will never get unanimous agreement about what the issues are that impossible some small proportion of the population will always feel like they being ignored and they may be right trans people are mentally ill and need professional help they are not and your belief is not supported by the professional community continuing to force acceptance of mental illness as normal is absurd normal is really a meaningful term in this context given your behavior in this thread how many professionals do you think would describe your mental state as healthy you are really in a place to be throwing stones here you have an actual problem they need help and we should be focusing our efforts on making professional help available they need support they do not need a cure i feel that homosexuality is another mental illness you are incorrect again now i do care if they want to marry but do force me to be a part of that shit the way that you phrased this is telling you are using the label mental illness not because you believe that the issue in question is a malady harmful to the person who holds it but because you are personally disgusted by it it revolts you mental illness is merely the most socially acceptable and even then not by much label you can apply while still objecting to it if a private business elects to decline service wedding cakes for example they should have every right to do so without being threatened brigaded and driven out of business by the hate brigade of the left hate brigade of the left is a really really misguided term i sure you feel differently about both of these subjects i do so does the majority of the country and so does nearly every medical and mental health professional your opinion is held by anyone in a position of topical knowledge you hold it for no other reason than that you were raised in a way that has instilled in you a deep seated disgust towards gay and trans people i repeat you hold your beliefs about transsexual and gay people for literally no other reason than that you were raised to be revolted by them you were failed by your upbringing and your current beliefs are the end result you are furious at the world because you were never taught how to deal with its pressures in a healthy way instead of looking inward and figuring out what in your own life is causing you to be so toxic towards others you externalize all of your anger in your mind literally the entire rest of the world is the problem i not here to debate these issues specifically your stance on these issues and your behavior in this thread paints a clear picture of the sort of person you are no one is here to debate those issues we had those debates and they over society has moved past your backwards views on gay people which i sure has only further served to increase your frustration and bitterness towards the world around you as the spaces you feel comfortable in shrink day by day all i saying is that it fucked up that you and the other guy want to decide for me how i should feel about these topics and many others we do really care how you feel we way past believing that it worthwhile to try and change your feelings if a lifetime of exposure to the rest of the world has fixed you we ca what we do care about is whether you in the way right now you in the way there is literally no hope left for humanity we deserve the extinction that climate change is bringing the same social circles that instilled in you a disgust for gay people are the social circles responsible for inaction on climate change
no need to twist my comment as something else everything i cited is either directly from your comments or literally cited and marked by you as correct you resorting to semantics here and never said anything about criticizing it but bitching about it as is the case in this thread are you reading your own text i can play this bullshit game too buddy let go never said anything about criticism bitching is a form of criticism please refrain from moving goalposts this is incorrect the lifestyle that is typical of the us middle class is of one not typical around most of the world that degree of scaled up massively is what makes it not fathomable please substantiat your claim that the scaled up version is unfathomable can you substantiate that accusation cause i willing to bet it bullshit from the new global frontier urbanization poverty and environment in the century by mcgrahan et al on unfettered city sprawl with american suburbanization as main example social and environmental considerations point to the limited benefits of unfettered sprawl in this sense sprawl can be seen as a classic case of the tragedy of the commons if all who have the necessary means were to contribute to urban sprawl everyone would lose those left behind in deteriorating cities in central or run down peripheral neighbourhoods are even farther away from the recreation and leisure afforded by the green spaces in outlying urban areas and resources that could be used to improve urban infrastructure are diverted to building highways and providing services in newly occupied remote areas the sprawlers themselves commute greater distances producing more pollution limiting interaction with families and reducing options for leisure time increase the costs of providing infrastructure and services and ultimately destory the green space they sought reducing it to the limits of their admittedly larger lots and the environment itself suffers from loss of biodiversity from compromising watershed protection and from accelerating climate change through emissions and paved over or built up areas all claims are being substantiated and lengthly discussed with counterpoints and criticism please inform yourself at some minimal level before taking such bets any google search with the keywords suburban and sustainability will do not sure what argument you trying to make here not sure what you arguing here that some people do nt desire luxury because of ethical choices the ecological vegan is an example of a person who severly changes his lifestyle to accomodate his ethical choices it is not relevant how many there are and it is not semantics it would be semantics if i would nt have given a specific reason why the taste of a person may not deem something luxurious as desirable but i gave a specific reason namely the consideration of sustainability not sure what so hard to understand here how did i move the goalposts read the hypothesis and please try to excercise basic reading comprehension this time they are direct citations of you and thereby already substantiated again this is what i said please stop refering to semantics no need to move goalposts what comments of mine are you referring to it is literally cited if you do nt get it hypothesis you counterthesis me not sure what your problem is here never said anything to suggest otherwise please stop refering to semantics no need to move goalposts you tried to put forth that arguing that it a lifestyle being conjured up by hollywood it not please provide citation and point out specifically where i used the words fabricating conjuring or making up otherwise i would like you to stop twisting my words and infering something i never said thank you
i was that guy once flight with a connection in chicago i stayed up all night so i could get to the airport at i always book window seats because i can lean against the side and sleep and in this case it was really a necessity because i needed to sleep ahead of a hour drive on the back end of hours of flying i was sitting in my window seat on the second leg during boarding when the mother in the middle seat of the row behind me asked if i would switch so she could sit next to her two kids i said i really would prefer the window seat and went back to trying to catch some zs she could believe she did get her way and said in a malicious way well they probably going to be a nightmare to sit next to those kids were a delight they watched their movies and did bug me at all then when i was awake and looking out the window at california wildfires the year old next to me made some remarkably insightful conversation about climate change
you not exonerated until some sort of charges criminal or civil or in this case legislative levied and then ended in a failure or abrupt loss at this moment nothing has been charged not because he is a criminal he is but because he ca be convicted of said criminality of which an impeachment is a criminal case either it just a legislative option to remove someone from office in which case you have to rely upon the new president to push charges against trump which would be pence or which can happen now have a state levy charges against him which would either new york or florida exoneration does happen until you can not prove your case especially of an official body absolve someone from blame for a fault or wrongdoing especially after due consideration of the case the real exoneration would be when mitch finds him not guilty impeachment at least provides additional investigative powers and allows the possibility of getting these gop scum bags on the record supporting his bullshit that true as well but it a gambit a gambit that will take time and effort to contend with time and effort that might best be spent on the candidates and the house and senate races so that real charges can be filed against trump impeachment is going to put anyone in jail perhaps for perjury but it might only clip a few people not mitch or pence although trump might fall for it if trump is impeachable just who the actual fuck is currently nobody you can impeach whoever you want from the wh all the way to the scotus mitch will never convict them but you can impeach for days and days non stop never ending impeachments does matter in the slightest mitch has the senate and will never allow for any convictions what does that say about democrats we not smart enough to get a conviction after everyone was impeached how much time did we waste on trying to impeach shithead when we should been more concerned with pushing a climate change bill or fixing our trade relations or whatever else we could be doing that is more positive than chasing a dream
it might be better than nothing if it does mitigate climate change to the degree it needs to then it is not in fact better than nothing
no worries because you can just sell them to aquaman
i actually said the ipcc or climate scientists i get a bit tired of the idea that if i find something wrong with al gore argument or ethics then agw is real al gore made mistakes in an inconvenient truth and i personally do know whether his ethics are impeccable or not however al gore did propose the idea of agw al gore did find the evidence for agw al gore did not find the evidence and develop the models to indicate that dramatic and dangerous changes are likely if you interested in the science how about having a look at the peer reviewed you do need to rely on al gore i just disagree with the chicken little like hysteria that it going to kill us all yep claiming that it going to kill us all probably would be very scientific and climate scientists do make that claim if you do have a look at the scientific literature though you see a strong evidentiary case for dramatic and dangerous climate change involving large sea level rises and major regional climate disruptions when chicken little tells you the sky is falling you have reason to be sceptical but when climate scientists can show you strong evidence that the bit of space between you and the sky is getting an awful lot hotter it a good idea to listen or at the very least read what they have to say
oh and one jeff bezos away is a hyperbole big corps drive the bulk of climate change and we have billionaires fucking off to the edge of space
interesting while i not sure that i agree with bill nye if he actually holds the view you suggest it nevertheless an interesting philosophical legal discussion it well established in the us that free speech is an unlimited right the conventional example is you ca yell fire in a crowded theater unless you think the theater is actually on fire we also have prohibitions on speech when it seems like it a specific call to action which rises to the level of illegal behavior if you a celebrity and you broadcast to your fans that they should kill someone and somebody does indeed kill that person you may be criminally liable so let make a small change to the yelling fire example and see what happens do you think it ok to tell everyone that there nothing wrong and they should stay in a theater even when you know it to be on fire if people then die because they did evacuate are you at fault should that be an illegal act does it raise to the level of reckless endangerment if you agree with the above i suspect many people will then the question at hand becomes whether climate change presents the same sort of immediate danger to life and limb that a structure fire presents to the inhabitants of the building i personally on the fence about that but i think there a compelling case to be made at least
i been watching documentaries about the crossings along the mara and on the river and basin itself for decades now it only recently occurred to me after watching another that it is very much under threat from many sides climate change human encroachment unsustainable agriculture and water siphoning among many but nkoinko siposha from oloroito village in the upper basin recalled that in the it was impossible for his cattle to wade through any part of the river because of its depth these days even goats walk leisurely through the drying river to graze on the other side of its shores the year old herder told the thomson reuters foundation
no problem i appreciate folks who care to stay informed and there a lot of subtle but important nuances involved that news articles ca convey seriously google those key lots of info if you want to learn more i basically got interested in climate change around the time ahnold was our governator and went back to school for it because i wanted to be a part of making a difference my main worry is making sure we get to a clean economy in a way that is socially equitable and economically sustainable we can not do this in a democracy if a majority of people do support and benefit from it and we can not be leaders in fighting climate change if nobody else is following california example because it too expensive or impractical
this and also in the people were producing atmospheric pollutants with cooling effects such as sulfur dioxide as well as those with warming effects such as the long term trends in the production of all of these pollutants was up and it was obvious how the production of these pollutants would change in the future if you had given a climate scientist of the time a scenario what happens if greenhouse gas production expands while production is eliminated the climate scientist could have told you that that implied global warming but it also seemed plausible at the time that emissions might grow fast while greenhouse gas emissions grew slowly or even declined and if you asked a climate scientist then or now what the effect of that would be they say well that depends you need to give me more precise numbers than that whereas since the late it been clear that increases in greenhouse gas emissions are far outstripping the increases in emissions in atmospheric pollutants that cool the planet which also tend to remain in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than the pollutants with warming effects
ignorance as virtue how easily established facts are ignored by someone life experience it now a virtue to denigrate book learning and education because they will lead to inconvenient reassessments of how to view the world see climate change flat earthers anti vaxxers evolution etc etc
op is a climate change denier literally hitler
have you ever disagreed with a war homeless genocide nuclear weapons climate change or something similar
by the speed of climate change queen guard should change to shorts
either way you look at climate change considering how much food comes from california this seems like a good thing
india will follow your example if westerners restrict themselves to child let see if westerners can do it afterall it the western countries that have contributed to the climate change in a major way
florida is extremly vulnerable to the effects of climate change according to that news report south florida is already seeing the effects in the form of rising sea levels and flooding parts of miami flood on a regular news local environment yet the state legislature wo even mention the words climate change the flooding is getting worse every year and you can literally drive to miami to see the results and they still refuse to act on it seriously there are no wake signs on the roads warning people not to drive too fast
yup and you can see brazil in on there too also deforestation desertification and soil degradation happens in the usa as well
electrical apprenticeship climate change is super duper real brother we need to replace every car truck bus plane ship and build new power plants distribution lines grid batteries home batteries public chargers home chargers indoor farming everything is going electric heating cooking etc and we need to do it by to become carbon neutral at the same time floods hail storms will become more severe and occur more often requiring lots of home repairs lots of work
that a neat idea and it works like that in a few limited applications but it is real life practical on our current scale of consumption meat consumption is rising globally and a un report estimated that it will grow by the same point in time that global emissions need to approach net zero for the world to limit the worst impacts of climate change to meet growing demand farmers continue to cut down forests to expand pastures if a rancher in brazil cuts down an acre of rainforest it wo matter if the cattle on it graze in a responsible way because the loss of the trees is significantly worse in most of the world grass fed beef means they cleared the forest to produce the beef says is it possible to raise a carbon neutral cow on many existing ranches and dairy farms the land would still be better off replanted with trees with the caveat that some regions like the california ranch near the park are naturally covered in grassland rather than forest and might make sense for grazing but it would be difficult if not impossible for the meat industry to meet demand if they only use native grassland grass fed cattle take longer to fatten so it takes more land to produce the same amount of meat as cattle eating feed one study found that current pasture in the could only support of the cattle that are raised now searchinger argues that even as farms shift to more responsible methods consumers will need to eat less beef
portland averages days of snow in november inches if you live by acadia or something well welcome to climate change with the rest of us
people stupidly attributing normal hot weather to climate change does mean it does exist
probably minneapolis since it in a blue state that is more resilient to climate change plus i already done columbus living
that because climate change is a hoax hopefully
you must either be joking or have mental illness did you read the whole page or simply picked some useless information almost unrelated to the current climate events occuring your own source that you provided emphasizes what i said even more according to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at nasa goddard institute for space studies giss the average global temperature on earth has increased by about celsius fahrenheit since this is probably where you stopped continue reading or stopped playing around with the funny temperature modell they put up for people like you two thirds of the warming has occurred since at a rate of roughly c per decade consistent to what i claimed a one degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans atmosphere and land by that much in the past a to two degree drop was all it took to plunge the earth into the little ice age a five degree drop was enough to bury a large part of north america under a towering mass of ice years ago and for your inability to understand most basic concepts as the maps show global warming does mean temperatures rose everywhere at every time by one degree temperatures in a given year or decade might rise degrees in one region and drop degrees in another exceptionally cold winters in one region might be followed by exceptionally warm summers or a cold winter in one area might be balanced by an extremely warm winter in another part of the globe i would yawn all day too if my brain was as empty and numb as yours maybe greta and nasa are conspiring against the people together
what they need to do is begin the process of discontinuing the use of fossil fuels as an primary energy source and start the work of building a renewable based energy infrastructure really they should have been working on that decades ago we known that even if climate change was a thing oil reserves are still ultimately finite hell there was a crash predicted in that was only averted when fracking took off and opened up a bunch of potential sites we could access before but that was still just adding a few years to the doomsday clock oh and the new fracking sites are already starting to run dry tick tock
excerpt past precedent suggests that if a populist era takes hold it might last as long as three decades but why should cycles in modern history last for roughly years one possible explanation is that the successful ideologies and the political movements they spawn go through a cycle of emulation followed by overshoot if new movements or politicians develop an aura of success they find imitators around the world that sense of ideological momentum then creates a demand for the original ideas behind the movement to be pushed further and faster and that leads to the over reach phase of the cycle an example of ideological over reach is the way in which the reaganite demand for lower taxes and less red tape eventually led to the excessive deregulation of finance culminating in the financial crisis the fact that populist and nationalist parties around the world are already taking their cue from mr trump suggests that the cycle of emulation is already well under way it is now standard practice for politicians such as viktor orban in hungary as well as messrs salvini and bolsonaro to imitate the trump playbook condemning globalism accusing the media of spreading fake news mocking the politically correct and scorning international organisations that attempt to deal with problems such as climate change or the resettlement of refugees
lol you literally used that group original grade as proof that biden and trump are the same on climate change then i show that not only did he listen to experts and improve his plan that same exact originaztion then campaigned for him and now they a bunch of teenagers this is the fact in the current system only one of the two major parties will have power one is better in pretty much any area that maters and the other is attempting a coup you refuse recognize while not perfect the dnc is far and away the better choice it funny how you go around calling people dumb and propaganda reading retards you swallowed the most obvious propaganda there is that the two parties are the same and therefore you should just not care you a chump brotha
people have been claiming noaa is lying for years and pretty much every accusation has been bullshit but that is besides the point the big problem is that climate change deniers assume for some strange reason that climate science is monolithic and that noaa is in charge of all climate science across the globe and is the end all be all when in reality it is if anything the opposite there is a global scientific community that does largely independent research on the field which has come to a near unanimous conclusion there have been actual meta studies written on just how much agreement there is in the literature noaa more often than not compiles and does meta analyses on data and models coupled with it own research and modeling those meta models that you see noaa producing they are called meta models for no reason
if you asking if the virus has genetic code that contains dna from two different species then the answer would be that it certainly is possible maybe even probable but that nothing new viruses have always done that while scientists are pretty much convinced the original animal host for covid was a bat they are not unanimous about a second host although the pangolin is a primary candidate a few weeks ago researchers discovered that minks were carriers of covid as well and million of them in denmark were culled most scientists think the virus went from humans to minks mutated and then went back to humans again if you implying that the virus was man made then i would repeat that the consensus of scientific opinion is that this is not the case that is not an appeal to authority it is simply the prudent thing to do when you are reporting on a subject that is not your direct area of expertise the appeal to authority fallacy is based on the idea that just because one authority on something posits an idea it must be true for example saying that because joe blow is an epidemiologist and he says the virus is man made it must be true because he is an expert that would be leaving out the critical flaw in the appeal to authority fallacy that the so called expert does not represent the scientific consensus all true scientific theories from gravity to evolution to climate change do not have unanimity you will always have outliers and they are scientists but to give outliers credence just because they scientists that is the appeal to authority fallacy
of course not all life is the same but this thread is talking about climate change therefore the person who has the largest environmental footprint is the one who needs to change i assuming that you an american who probably has a family and such in that case you technically part of the problem as we all are to an extent i extremely doubt that starting a world war would decrease the population and reverse climate change in fact it would increase due to the proliferation of manufacturing and devastation of the environment killed around of the world population which might sound like alot but that nothing compared to how much you would need to reverse climate change
why do you say amazingly that seems like a huge proportion considering so few people relative to the overall worldwide population actually use airlines i noticed an odd silence from activists and journalists on the topic and my guess is it because it makes many in their audience uncomfortable to hear that they are in a tiny affluent minority that causes a disproportionate of ghg emissions for an activity that is a luxury the vast majority of the time it fun to shake your fist at the government or corporations but air flight is a high energy use activity that is worse than eating beef and driving a gas guzzler truck when presented with this people always talk about how corporations are trying to shift the blame onto the population but that just does apply here no corporation is forcing you to fly
the chinese hegemony is really flimsy imo i dunno if they become a superpower when the regime is ripping the souls out of its citizens plus global climate change is gon na cause tensions to grow between china and india and russia without competent leadership the chinese people are set to have a rough century ahead
i forgot to add the head of the epa just publicly disputed humanity role in climate scott pruitt carbon dioxide climate i mean if it a chinese hoax does that mean humanity is to blame
reminiscent of that sneer y nyt editorial scott recently covered again i feel like the actual unadorned non clickbaity kernel buried in both articles is probably worth writing about whether or not one might agree but no one is going to click on that the whole article could basically be reduced to the following two paragraphs plus a sentence or two and convey what they want to convey much more effectively and reasonably even if it be hard to justify an entire article for it i should emphasize that rejecting longtermism does not mean that one must reject long term thinking you ought to care equally about people no matter when they exist whether today next year or in a couple billion years henceforth if we should discriminate against people based on their spatial distance from us we should discriminate against them based on their temporal distance either many of the problems we face today such as climate change will have devastating consequences for future generations hundreds or thousands of years in the future that should matter we should be willing to make sacrifices for their wellbeing just as we make sacrifices for those alive today by donating to charities that fight global poverty but this does not mean that one must genuflect before the altar of future value or our potential understood in techno utopian terms of colonizing space becoming posthuman subjugating the natural world maximizing economic productivity and creating massive computer simulations stuffed with digital beings on greaves and macaskill wp content uploads the case for strong longtermism gpi working paper if we were to colonize the milky way care about the long term i like to say but do be a longtermist superintelligent machines are going to save us and climate change really should be one of our top global priorities whether or not it prevents us from becoming simulated posthumans in cosmic computers
the lack of replenishment is due to in part climate change
when you investing into a business capital stock it means you adding to or improving one of three things buildings and structures office tower or oil well machinery and equipment cnc machines and dump trucks or intellectual property mostly software but sometimes things like buying a patent to manufacture a drug from to partly because there were tons of oil and gas profits begging to be used partly because banks were for a change competing hard with each other to lend money and partly because there were a lot of bargains to be had crash our businesses bought record levels of all three since we bought quite a bit less machinery equipment and software and a little bit less buildings and structures we can never really save on buildings and structures because the climate here is so much harder on them than in most other non scandinavian countries the cd howe inst says the drop in machinery and equipment purchasing is a big red flag because that kind of purchasing is usually in developed countries depending on context an important forward indicator of gdp growth ragnaroksunset says you expect to see a long decline after a seven year binge and is implying that cd howe and similar economic commentators cry wolf too often because they take natural cyclical spending changes and draw straight line forecasts from whatever going on right now in my opinion both make fair points we probably are going to see machinery and equipment spending heading back up until there more certainty available about long term borrowing costs if we do see that spending really bouncing up in three or four years time though cd howe may have called it correctly even if they jumped the gun a bit eta what also missing from the cd howe study is any mention of the idea that nafta eliminated many companies need to maintain parallel facilities in the us and canada the more companies serving both populations from the us the less capital stock bought in canada
what they fixed climate change
they care a lot more about climate change than your government
i do expect my house to burn down but i have insurance i do plan to die yet but i have a will i do plan to crash my car but i wear a seatbelt always have a plan b if the alternative is disaster even if it seems unlikely personal view climate change will be a slow death we may be suffering in years but not to the point where we living in caves if anything i rather have the money to keep my house cool when i old and vulnerable than to assume i already have been killed by the lions that will live in surrey in
climate change
his statement to ipcc author climate report alarmist is precisely within his field tol said the ipcc emphasised the risks of climate change far more than the opportunities to adapt a reuters count shows the final draft has mentions of risk and of opportunity that an economic argument if he as one of seventy authors of the ipcc report holds the professional opinion that the economic impacts of a changing climate will not be all that detrimental to certain nations specifically cold european nations then it is his professional responsibility to voice his concern that that opinion is not reflected in the ipcc report attempting to attack his right to voice that opinion as you are doing here is both counter productive and unscientific the issue here is one of cherrypicking the person you are responding to cherrypicked the opinion of one dissenting author out of seventy as a leading economist his opinion mattered enough to be asked onto that panel so it should matter enough now but only in comparison to the weight of opinion of the other sixty nine authors you should direct your attack in that direction
but no by all means let continue to pretend that years worth of humanity in a select number of countries is responsible for all our current problems oh yes how dare we blame the generation who is currently sitting idle by not doing anything about climate change because it wo effect them who cares about the past that s already happened we are more worried about the present and the future because we are actually fucking living during the present and future
and all of that could be regulated by proper climate change legislation workers rights legislation there was a bill going through the canadian government that would make businesses confirm that none of their products are made in sweatshops employing children or by people who are working excessive hours for free or unfair pay there a way to accomplish this stuff and it not ragging on a women driven industry being mad they make money
science does lie but when the people in charge of the data lie as in the ipcc deleting or altering pertinent data before foia were issued or changing their computer models to reflect lower temps from the past you get the gist of it good excerpt from the article this in itself has become a major scandal not least dr jones refusal to release the basic data from which the cru derives its hugely influential temperature record which culminated last summer in his startling claim that much of the data from all over the world had simply got lost most incriminating of all are the emails in which scientists are advised to delete large chunks of data which when this is done after receipt of a freedom of information request is a criminal offence but the question which inevitably arises from this systematic refusal to release their data is what is it that these scientists seem so anxious to hide the second and most shocking revelation of the leaked documents is how they show the scientists trying to manipulate data through their tortuous computer programmes always to point in only the one desired direction to lower past temperatures and to adjust recent temperatures upwards in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming this comes up so often not least in the documents relating to computer data in the harry read me file that it becomes the most disturbing single element of the entire story this is what mr mcintyre caught dr hansen doing with his giss temperature record last year after which hansen was forced to revise his record and two further shocking examples have now come to light from australia and new zealand
it actually one of the top cited suggestions for combating climate change i agree now how does one remove the demand for beef
except do buy from butchers because we need to drastically reduce meat consumption to fight the other great threat of our age climate change
no the problem is that you all think musk ever said he wants to go to mars because of climate change but that is absolutely not the case that is the problem with this whole thread everyone talking out their ass so no wonder no one can agree musk said he wants to go to mars to save humanity from some other future catastrophic event be it ai or a meteor which is pretty likely like as far as one that wipes out a couple cities and potentially causes global famine but not quite snap the earth in two and guarantee extinction nasa says there like millions of those that they ca track many ways humanity can end forever if it on one planet even war or a bad epidemic considering the ultra connected nature of today world week symptom free mortality and all humans are dead just like that a month trip buffer to a whole separated self sustaining civ is very nice russia can want to nuke it as much as they want it will still take them months so many ways humanity can be over tomorrow he never said mars is because of climate change that you all being stupid obviously it not obviously it would be easier to terraform earthform earth than mars what r all u smokin need to get better shiz i think
question if that s the case then why emerge now theory like other viruses some of them are frozen in ice maybe due to climate change they thawed causing them to be alive and repopulating
i do agree man is partly responsible for climate change but i arguing is that there is a wide consensus on how much of it is man made and how much is due to the nature of shifts in weather over the course of the planets time line again i believe that climate change is a thing and that it caused rising sea levels and other natural phenomenas but i believe it not as fast as people make it out to be and we are going to be underwater in years time and what the best way to combat it is
you think they only donate in election years they get annual donations and most fiscal years where lobbying dollars are allocated just happens to fall within your six month window i do want to lose money now but i see the big picture if we can set a bipartisan foundation now we have a much higher chance of getting hr minimum wage a public health option student loan relief climate change infrastructure etc passed within this administrative term i seeing the big picture and i do want to lose dinner over a am potato chip
yeah no just about every scholarly article i read concluded that the pnw is one of the least affected parts of the world wrt climate change
i had a facebook account for one week in i deleted the account after several days of realizing a few things i did not care that other people knew what i was thinking or what was going on in my life and i did not care what people were having for lunch or much else i found myself just not caring to post anything and then i stopped caring about reading what other people were posting the problem with social media for me is it encourages quantity over quality people overestimate the importance of the mundane things that happen to them of course if something important or inspiring happens i want to know about it i just do want to wade through memes political shit and photos of your coffee to find those things in any case no facebook no twitter no instagram nothing and i do ever feel like i missing anything especially in this climate where people politically sloganeer at each other and then like and upvote or like or share or whatever the sloganeering i rather chew aluminum foil i remain surprised people consider it such a big deal or a big change to simply stop using it and the meltdowns i seen people have as a result of it indicates how unhealthy it is for so many people i think when we in the company of real live human beings we choose our words and we filter what comes out of our mouths i think when it comes to social media people are less apt to do that and the result is a tsunami of peoples mental diarrhea hurting feelings causing rifts embarrassment creating online mobs ostracism gossip and cliques that happens on reddit but since we all anonymous here with ephemeral accounts it just dust in the wind do miss it frees up time for reading and staring at the horizon and other such things one thing i know for certain if anyone ever googles me there is nothing even slightly embarrassing about me online there is a technical abstract published under my name and a few mailing list posts on a technical topic my digital history is essentially curated no drunken posts no embarrassing pictures of me drunk no photos of me exist online in any form no political bullshit i do have a webpage which is also carefully constructed with thoughtful material rather than things i blurted out as people do on social media all this works for me people should do what they want people who want to have a conversation with me should visit or invite me to visit that still best
ah but your assessment is also mine i would much rather have someone post a link and have it discussed rather than have a troll appear and attack someone personally as some climate activists do some just post and then defend their posting and this is fine a few repeatedly get mods involved and lobby against those who dispute their posts this is an ongoing drama someone posts something that suggests a question about the consensus view of climate change and the woodwork erupts in a number of cases the entire post or vast stretches of the post are deleted due to mods who are activists and will allow little or no debate about an article while allowing attacks on those who raise questions i would think that in a few hours this submission will disappear or be gutted that is why i cross posted the link where others interested could see it prior to it disappearing
no doubt but there is also a culture that discourages asking questions and encourages blind acceptance try having a rational discussion about climate change with someone and asking some questions about noaa temperature alteration its proprietary smoothing algorithms and comparing the initial model predictions from years ago with current reality and you get a lot of accusations of denier or just its been settled by the experts
like i said temperature is a lagging indicator of climate also degree per century taken over a long enough time is a devastating change for some context the paleocene eocene thermal maximum a climate change event that caused an extinction event and drastically altered life on land and in the ocean consisted of an degree f change over years that degrees per century that was one of the most drastic warming events in the history of the earth and now we are warming at one degree per century even if all the projections are off and we are only going to continue increasing at one degree per century that times faster than the fastest climate has ever increased in earth history unfortunately most climate projections put our current warming as the base of an exponential increase over the next few decades we only need it to go a few degrees either way to drastically change life on earth most organisms thrive in a relatively narrow band of temperatures and a few degree difference one way or another can destroy entire ecosystems for example the corals in the ocean the great barrier reef all of that that will be gone inside of years this is something that the coral do every time the water gets above a certain temperature they done it throughout the history of the earth and they come back about years later which is great for the coral but pretty sad for us and on top of being sad for us all the fish and predators that rely on the coral as th base of their ecosystem will be gone as well and so will all the fishing industries that rely on those ecosystems and all the large economies of the world with fishing components will be severely impacted i do not have sources for either the coral claim i just made or the claim of increased storms i am very sorry to not have these sources but as i said i am only answering your questions to the best of my ability as a college sophomore i have done any independent research and this stuff is from my history of the earth professor for what it worth he was indeed a climatologist so i feel pretty secure in writing what he taught me
it does help when it used to explain every weather pattern though too hot climte change too cold same mild weather climate change too many hurricanes too few etc
what are you referencing please provide some sources so i can read i referencing the liberal targets which keep getting worse megatonnes by the estimate goes up to what happens in that is a mt change in year carbon pricing has been proven effective in multiple jurisdictions carbon pricing will produce emissions reductions it just wo we will expand the oil sands and never meet those targets under this government experts say the carbon price as to be above dollars per ton this government says they will freeze in like how do we meet those targets
citing one of the top scientists at noaa saying we rushed this study and made up a couple numbers to ensure we got the trillion dollars at the paris agreement where the top scientist himself said the only issue was that it was rushed to publication he said there was no data falsification he said that not me yes the guy in the second article lied but guess what he is a scientist he a political advisor he did lie about anything to do with climate change or data falsification and one instance of someone lying does not mean everyone at the agency routinely lies
he were lied to about irag powell gave a speech to the un that was untrue there was a massive implied connection between and iraq that was all made up and climate change is the one that i find the most repugnant there is massive amounts of scientific consensus on that subject when you actually do talk to a climate scientists they can tell you that as well and we have a candidate furthering the lie that it is made up by the chinese which is absolutely untrue
there was also massive issues giving voters who had registered and paid their dues access to the new online ballot they mailed out access codes because even though most of us now bank online daily they believed printing and hand delivering pieces of paper was the way to go the post officie issues were also much more prevalent in urban areas with many voters and mail backlogs resulting from a non election related problem meaning the electorate was likely skewed many voters also did not understand the ballot or the voting strategies that could be employed in this system the point is they tried a new system and it was bungled not because of the system itself simply because it was new now i have a premier who does believe in climate change or trans rights even though i live in one of the most progressive cities on earth
bitcoin is fatally flawed but there is another option iota is energy efficient responsibly designed and sustainable working with industries and governments to not replace currency but to make the world operate more efficiently and effectively
i do know what metaphor it could be but when i think of the pale encroaching it feels like the same feeling i have almost everyday that funny feeling the pandemic climate change russia invading billionaires hoarding their wealth while children starve extremists rising to power it all feels like everything ending or the world gone crazy or something but you still have to live your life you still have to go grocery shopping wash the dishes go to a friend birthday all while everytime you look at the news it feels like epic world changing events are happening and it makes you feel like how am i supposed to focus on buying milk at the store when we on the verge of apocalyptic events spoilers ahead that what so beautiful about the church scene to me you learn that the pale is starting right there in that spot that everything there will eventually all be absorbed by nothingness and you just dance and that really moved me like even when it feels like it all falling apart around you and nothing matters keep living keep doing what you doing hang out with friends spend too much money on something you love take a sick day at work and watch shitty tv it may not matter in the end but who cares just enjoy the one life the one moment you given that the pale metaphor to me anyway
the ndp green liberals conservatives or ppc do not get a free pass just for saying they believe in climate change the policies have to work and i do not believe they do
devastating climate change will be occuring and humanity is not equipped to survive it
at this point we trying to buy ourselves time and hope that we can minimize the effects to something survivable if we ca do this then what we will see is the breakdown of civil society as the environment becomes hostile to human life sea levels will rise drowning cities across the coasts that will spur mass migration of climate refugees we will continue to cross various tipping points that create irreversible changes to our current climate systems weather patterns will be disrupted everywhere as regional climates change into something we no longer recognize that mediterranean climate is now a desert eh hem california the amazon is now savannah etc this creates famine and water scarcity across the globe leading to war and mass death of all animals have gone extinct the entire ocean is one big dead zone only the most prolific plant species are left and they are colonizing new areas as older plant communities are lost in the worst effects earth tips irreversibly into a state known as hot house earth which will have a climate similar to what the dinosaurs lived in anyway i could go on but imagining this as the world my child will inherit just absolutely ruins me so instead i like to imagine a different scenario it the world became woke and joined together to solve the climate crisis we are still experiencing its effects but we figured out a way to efficiently sequester mass amounts of carbon that offset the worlds current and some historical emissions weather patterns have changed sea levels have risen but technological innovation has allowed us to adapt across the world countries are taking part in mass environmental restoration projects and animal and plant communities are starting to rebound we found a way to live sustainably i think it can and is really starting to be done just look how quickly our lives changed since the first cell phone was released it also been noted that we on the verge of the next industrial revolution that is centered on renewable energy and ai about to see rapid and sweeping changes across all sectors as the sustainable option becomes the only affordable or profitable one source i a former climate change planner who follows recent developments about climate wish i had more sources but i got to get back to work we got this i hope
i sure she not personally blaming you for not taking a bike to work and using a car and i sure a lot of people that are concerned about climate change are not also war hawks if you are wondering why obama does seem to be criticized for this stuff he is from a further left perspective quite often in america you often have some conservative want to criticize like this as if obama shitty foreign policy somehow means climate warming is real and we do need to do a collective action about it i mean no you driving a hybrid is gon na make things better we need to all collectively change our behaviors for the environment once it done it wo be controversial or anything remember when cars were using lead gasoline and polluting up cities in the and nobody is screaming shit about how we need to add lead back into gasoline so oil companies can make even more money anymore
if only climate change would ignite another nation race to stop it similar to the race to the moon that would be pretty rad imho the issue with dunes is its strategic placement dunes on the moon are a bit out of sight are they
gore defeats bush in the presidential election first there a far less destabilized middle east it is a fair question to ask whether gore would have proceeded differently on the warnings prior to but even if we assume happens either way he would have responded differently in its aftermath bush had a personal grudge against hussain for threatening bush sr life and used to justify invading iraq gore would have given a shit about iraq and would have just prosecuted the war against the taliban in afghanistan just not having the iraq war massively changes world history and our current environment second no citizens united which means our current superpac controlled election environment would be very different both roberts and alito were key votes on the decision democratic nominees would have been likely to side with stevens ginsburg assuming she did retire breyer and sotomayor in his dissent stevens famously wrote that a democracy can not function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold imagine if that was the holding instead of the dissent there are a lot of other possibilities as well if nothing else we would have had have some sort of real action on climate change as it was gore pet issue but at minimum no iraq war and no citizens united would make for a very different and much less bleak present
you brush off climate change like it wo be our problem it will be and within the next thirty years you regret treating it so frivolously
not hot enough for this change you need to learn some science as well as how to apply the inverse square law every item in the solar system would go up according to the inverse square law but i guess assume there is a billion people in on some conspiracy theory that could be debunked by a test any corporation university could do telling people to do their homework is the height of irony coming from a science denier learn some science anthropomorphic global warming agw is a fact in fact it so simply even you could devise a test visible light strikes the earth testable yes tested yes could anyone devise a test yes visible light has nothing for to absorb so it pass right on through testable yes tested yes could anyone devise a test yes when visible light strike an object ir is generated testable yes tested yes could anyone devise a test yes green house gasses such as absorb from ir testable yes tested yes could anyone devise a test yes humans produce more other green house gasses then can be absorbed through the cycle testable yes tested yes could anyone devise a test yes each one of those has been tested a lot you notice deniers do actual address the facts of agw do have a test that shows those facts to be false so now you have to answer why do you think trapping more in the lower atmosphere does not impact the climate
stuff like this makes me hesitant to go to other countries because i do want to continuously have to prove the stereotype is wrong anyway do get me wrong some americans are very ignorant but the fact that you even posted this shows you know that some are not this ignorant honestly i think ignorance like this is just due to a bad education system and isolationism keep in mind that we are miles from europe i think we just do value learning things about the british geography etc in school because many people will never even meet a british person or even go to europe once in their entire life time we take world history classes or geography classes but the information is just so broad that you get a snippet from each country and each civilization and to be completely honest there many things i did even know until i dated a english man in school we rewarded for doing the bare minimum learn the info for the test because the state told us this is what you need to know and nothing more intellectual curiosity is rare additionally i think the polarization of issues such as climate change is chalked up to our governmental system two party sectionalism many of our founding fathers where aware that the size of america human nature etc will always lead to polarization we self cannibalize because we just want to be on a team despite what they believe people are ideologically inconsistent or act like they have extensive knowledge of issues when they simply just feed into their own bias that why some people will discount climate because it feeds into their already established ideals that taxing bad and hurts business they look at studies that confirm their bias
climate change makes everything a diceroll there are so many aspects related to it that noone can really predict what will happen long term anymore despite that the migration it will cause wo be immediate like refugees fleeing a war rather it will be a slow process how much all of that will change manufacturing will be a product of which environmental policies which countries develop and how much companies will choose to follow them
this is true the only difference between these two areas is not just temperature it seems like this sub is rightly scared this study might discourage climate change prevention but let not deny facts in the conversation
i certainly hope not but then again they could bond over their performative climate change activism
alright despite your unwarranted examples the fact of the matter is that most people do not benefit from capitalism even ignoring the harms you find in developing countries our current economic system is bringing harms to most americans income inequality is research poverty and inequality a guide to statistics on historical trends in income inequality while wages flatline and worker productivity wages vs the bottom line on our economic mobility is that your parents level of wealth is the strongest determiner of your future of images and those are just economic harms perhaps the ultimate damage of capitalism is our environmental destruction fossil fuels are profitable and therefore we have climate change exxon knew about climate change in but they kept it secret and funded research to deny the facts to keep profits exxon climate climate denier funding it is simply incorrect to say that everyone benefits from capitalism
then they had to save the world from climate change or something they gave up at the
climate change is a big challenge of our time but the preceding years had to deal with the threat of the nuclear war biochemical weapons constant high tension by the cold war multiple proxy wars pollutions of various kinds sex and racial discriminations genocides in to countries etc etc what we face will not be more or less challenging than what the previous generations had to deal with
because humanity lived through an ice age with no technology but fire and spears things will be hard and we adapt i think you being foolish to think we can protest factories into desolation and then they be no more problems your conflating every potential future problem into one word and worrying compulsively about it and it such a bad frame to look through because you ca do anything about it but worry scientists measure the climate and deduce it changing and deduce we an influencer of the climate big news stop the world should we go out of our way to stop industry because stopping human influence on the change in climate assuredly will keep everything hunky dory
so using your logic a study into police shootings where of the articles mention race proves white cops shoot black suspects of the time because we just all know it you still do get that study if you think your example is an analogy using your example if a meta study of police shooting studies shows that the vast majority of studies show rising shooting rates then it right to assume wait for it rate of shootings is in an up trend now if of those same studies also analyze shootings per race and conclude african americans are more likely to get shot then that does mean there is now a certainty that this is the case just that only of the total studies analyzed even look at racial stats whether the racial stats findings are correct depends on whether the studies have been peer reviewed and whether they proper scientific studies using scientific method if that the case you can make the claim that black citizens are more likely to be shot in short of all climate studies analyzed conclude the globe is warming that is an incredible amount of independent studies all coming to the same conclusion based on actual data so yeah the globe is warming of all those studies looked at the root causes for the recent drastic change in temperatures and concluded humans are to blame again based on data a lot of the overall studies did do that they merely analyzed temperature trends not the cause behind them as for your silly little shitty blogger accusation they link to scientific papers so your accusation makes you look like a bit of a retard also again of the studies that do look at the causes for global warming the overwhelming majority comes to the conclusion we are to blame that why every single major scientific body supports that conclusion it also why you sound like a flat earther denying those findings
his handling of the pandemic will also have a big impact i not an expert on hungarian politics but from what i seen in other countries i expect many populist authoritarian leaders to fall after the pandemic trump bolsonaro johnson and lukashenko at least are very likely to go down as they tried to downplay the pandemic as people being hysterical and it being just a flu that sort of populism may work with climate change or immigration but the pandemic is going to devastate those countries i do know about orb√°n though he seem a bit less populist and more authoritarian and he did request emergency powers quite early in the outbreak and i do know what the situation is in hungary atm but it seems like there are not many cases of corona yet time will tell how he handle it and how people will react to it
how is a forest fire caused by humans climate change
division of labor technology hunter gatherers are generalists civilization is specialization progress is increasing specialization increased specialization means we are ever more dependent on a fragile system and have less influence over our own lives which is why modern culture prays for scientists to figure out climate change which is why it does really matter if you have an electric car because the technological system goes marching in until we all fall down
we will see how long that lasts when climate change takes full effect and antarctica becomes a paradise
no significant change in temperatures period this is reality not a false reality you propose a false reality by claiming that f is anything other than natural variation what have i said that is alarmist or scaremongering any time someone shows that there is no cause for concern you show up trying to show data that supports the supposed climate emergency that your beloved un and ipcc claim trillions must be redistributed you a puppet for those that flat out state the need to change the economic model of the west that as alarmist as it gets
that not how it works china india and the united states account for nearly three quarters of global emissions this is an everybody needs to do their part thing three players are the biggest drivers of climate change we make zero difference handicapping the canadian economy for no benefit is stupid liberals love feelings over facts policies though
how many horses still have jobs relative to that era there were more human replacement jobs yes but we were being replaced they were replacing of service jobs driving and other jobs which make up the vast majority of employment is not going to create an equal number of jobs more jobs maintaining equipment sure more total jobs no a handful of techs can maintain dozens of machines and over time more can be automated just because you hear it frequently and disagree does mean it not a real near future issue and more than climate change stupid being an issue because others are concerned about it
i liking the idea of a protest board around the wh post your grievances on it for the world to see climate change police brutality women rights all of them
they slow but they can still be part of the solution rewilding will definitely be key to fighting climate change once govs actually start caring about it instead of posturing
look up the many climate scientist supplying real information the climate changes are happening way faster than the usual models predict good sources say in yrs we can have a ice free arctic which can then cause destruction of the majority of crops and widespread famine start with a real scientist paul beckwith climate change is just part if it humans caused ecological overshoot we are in the middle of the massive extinction event and humans are on the list
fuck geology its using more fossil fuels and undeniably contributing to climate change you deny that
i all for a healthy amount of skepticism but when it gets to the point where people are arguing their opinion against thousands of experts speaking in unison it gone too far this is what modern republicans do now they do read books but they experts on everything could tell you the first thing about climate science but are convinced climate change is a hoax do know the first thing about epidemiology but are certain will only kill actually it does kill people the numbers are being reported incorrectly to sabotage trump
but they have been around longer than us humans yeah but they have had to deal with humans before we responsible for habitat loss ecosystem disruption overfishing that has lead to their natural dietary changes deaths from boating deaths from plastic ingestion and illness from run off pollution and all of that is not counting our effect on climate change and the subsequent consequences also yes we had some great nesting seasons but keep in mind that we only been collecting data since we can only speculate on their numbers before then and a large part of their success is more likely to be because of conservation efforts than the turtles recovering on their own also more nests is necessarily a good sign it could mean the overall population is recovering or it could also mean that there are just more females probably some combination of the two but we currently can only estimate their numbers in the wild temperature and humidity of the nests heavily effects the sex of the hatchlings with more females being produced in warmer drier conditions and warmer drier conditions mean overall lower nest viability we had a great year for viable nests this year but last year was not nearly as good despite the high number of nests so long story short every hatchling is important they need our help to balance out the damage that we doing and we need to take responsibility for their future
i fortunate to work in every lockdown i been done with politics ever since science was an after thought to cutting the red ribbon it not that i do have faith in humanity it that i seen the worst of humankind and best but goddamn the can worst really get to you people often misinterpret me as an angry person i not i just disappointed in everything from each genders rights climate change this whole fucking shit show of and how all our leaders are trying to justify that we need to protect the economy which has been fragile for quite some time now over people health and wellbeing the amount of money that has been spent on all states lockdowns would be enough money to buy the vaccines for australia and all the other islands countries we neighbour with i not angry just disappointed how can i sit idlily and watch the world burn gasoline has already flooded the planet and we are all holding a lit match
zika named for a forest in uganda is a flavivirus a type of virus that mutates frequently scientists believe a new mutation to the zika virus may explain the emergence of birth defects and other side effects not seen in past outbreaks so it both climate change but also these particular symptoms have recently come into being
you made some bold claims be another baseless con man show me the evidence that the percentage of climate scientists is far lower than that figure experts in the industry you said mostly not made up of experts so prove that scientists receive money to do research in every country around the world demonstrate to me that globally the issue of climate change is special as in it just a front to get money i am aware of the temperature increase causing the sea level to rise lol show me the data from climate scientists that say the only real risk is an increase in sea level nothing more back up your claims or continue to stay up late eating cheetos and watching alex jones with nothing substantive the choice is yours
the answer to this question should be yes if implememented correctly nuclear power would be the answer to the increasing energy demands and climate change
problem reaction solution pandemic was planned new world order attempt at least by my count cold war terrorism pandemic could probably throw climate change in there somewhere
voters in his state have a vested interest in not doing anything about climate change it is just rich coal execs in wv who oppose environmental regulations
one hundred percent of our focus is on stopping this new administration we confronted with severe challenges from a new administration and a narrow majority of democrats in the house and a senate to turn america into a socialist country and that percent of my focus moscow mitch i wish people would stop and think republicans believe the republican party is more important than america or indeed in this climate change example more important than the entire world
which is why people should stick to calling it climate change instead of global warming it much more accurate
parallel evolution parallel evolution is the similar development of a trait in distinct species which are not not closely related but share a similar original trait in response to similar evolutionary pressure parallel convergent evolution given a particular trait that occurs in each of two lineages descended from a specified ancestor it is possible in theory to define parallel and convergent evolutionary trends strictly and distinguish them clearly from one however the criteria for defining convergent as opposed to parallel evolution often are unclear in practice so that arbitrary diagnosis is common in some cases when two species are similar in a particular character evolution is defined as parallel if the ancestors shared that similarity if they did not the evolution of that character in those species is defined as convergent however this distinction is not clear cut for one thing the stated conditions are partly a matter of degree all organisms share more or less recent common ancestors in evolutionary biology the question of how far back to look for similar ancestors and how similar those ancestors need be for one to consider parallel evolution to have taken place can not always be resolved some scientists accordingly have argued that parallel evolution and convergent evolution are more or less others insist that in practice we should not shy away from the gray area because many important distinctions between parallel and convergent evolution when the ancestral forms are unspecified or unknown or the range of traits considered is not clearly specified the distinction between parallel and convergent evolution becomes more subjective for instance richard dawkins in the blind watchmaker describes the striking similarity between placental and marsupial forms as the outcome of convergent evolution because mammals on their respective ancestral continents had a long evolutionary history prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs that period of separation would have permitted the accumulation of many relevant differences stephen jay gould differed he described some of the same examples as having started from the common ancestor of all marsupials and placentals and hence amounting to parallel evolution and certainly whenever similarities can be described in concept as having evolved from a common attribute deriving from a single remote ancestral line that legitimately may be regarded as parallel evolution in contrast where quite different structures clearly have been co opted to a similar form and function one must necessarily regard the evolution as convergent for example consider mixotricha paradoxa a eukaryotic microbe which has assembled a system of rows of apparent cilia and basal bodies closely resembling the system in ciliates however on inspection it turns out that in mixotricha paradoxa what appear to be cilia actually are smaller symbiont microorganisms there is no question of parallel evolution in such a case again the differently oriented tails of fish and whales derived at vastly different times from radically different ancestors and any similarity in the resultant descendants must therefore have evolved convergently any case in which lineages do not evolve together at the same time in the same ecospace might be described as convergent evolution at some point in time the definition of a trait is crucial in deciding whether a change is seen as divergent or as parallel or convergent for example the evolution of the sesamoid thumb of the giant panda certainly is not parallel to that of the thumbs of primates particularly hominins and it also differs morphologically from primate thumbs but from some points of view it might be regarded as convergent in function and appearance again in the image above note that since serine and threonine possess similar structures with an alcohol side chain the example marked divergent would be termed parallel if the amino acids were grouped by similarity instead of being considered individually as another example if genes in two species independently become restricted to the same region of the animals through regulation by a certain transcription factor this may be described as a case of parallel evolution but examination of the actual dna sequence will probably show only divergent changes in individual basepair positions since a new transcription factor binding site can be added in a wide range of places within the gene with similar effect a similar situation occurs considering the homology of morphological structures for example many insects possess two pairs of flying wings in beetles the first pair of wings is hardened into elytra wing covers with little role in flight while in flies the second pair of wings is condensed into small halteres used for balance if the two pairs of wings are considered as interchangeable homologous structures this may be described as a parallel reduction in the number of wings but otherwise the two changes are each divergent changes in one pair of wings similar to convergent evolution evolutionary relay describes how independent species acquire similar characteristics through their evolution in similar ecosystems but not at the same time such as dorsal fins of sharks cetaceans and ichthyosaurs examples colouration that serves as a warning to predators and for mating displays has evolved in many different species in the plant kingdom the most familiar examples of parallel evolution are the forms of leaves where very similar patterns have appeared again and again in separate genera and families in arabidopsis thaliana it has been suggested that populations adapt to local climate through parallel evolution in butterflies many close similarities are found in the patterns of wing colouration both within and among families old and new world porcupines shared a common ancestor both evolved strikingly similar quill structures this is also an example of convergent evolution as similar structures evolved in hedgehogs echidnas and tenrecs some extinct archosaurs evolved an upright posture and likely were warm blooded these two characteristics are also found in most mammals modern crocodiles have a four chambered heart and a crurotarsal the latter being also a characteristic of therian mammals the extinct pterosaurs and the birds both evolved wings as well as a distinct beak but not from a recent common ancestor internal fertilization has evolved independently in sharks some amphibians and amniotes the patagium is a fleshy membrane that is found in gliding mammals such as flying lemurs flying squirrels sugar gliders and the extinct volaticotherium these mammals all acquired the patagium independently pyrotherians evolved a body plan similar to proboscideans the extinct south american litoptern ungulate thoatherium had legs that are difficult to distinguish from those of horses the eye of the octopus has the same complicated structure as the human eye as a result it is often substituted in studies of the eye when using a human eye would be inappropriate as the two species diverged at the time animals evolved into vertebrates and invertebrates this is extraordinary certain arboreal frog species flying frogs in both old world families and new world families have developed the ability of gliding flight they have enlarged hands and feet full webbing between all fingers and toes lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs and reduced weight per snout vent length the tree plant habit has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants
first no one here is thinking or stating satellites lie the climate change guy and a cup of coffee whatever are two people who regularly post here that said that satellites lie
anyone who talks about doing something about climate change and focussing the changes required in the developed countries is just virtue signaling and an hypocrite in my view china india and the east asia is responsible for the vast majority of lack of environmental concern activist might point out that this is to serve the consumers in western countries and that may be so but it means that any solution regarding climate change must come from protectionism measures against these countries until they respect the environment more and there is single politician willing to do that and its donald j trump until anyone else is willing to take climate change seriously all other solutions are laughable as if making me drink from a mushy paper straw will change the world cmon
the current global warming trend of climate change is man made without us pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere we would be in the middle of a cooling trend
climate change is even on the list
there a problem though beaming solar power directly is like using the solar system used at solomon directly on earth it makes for a good climate change read global warming so unless they can somewhat build something that like an orbital elevator that can be used as conduit electrical wire it harmful to the climate every time gundam x dx uses the satellite cannon on earth it increases the radiation pollution in victory there was a orbiting energy satellite called hiland it kinda feasible cuz at that time the earth population was declining and zanscare was helping out as well but in our current world situation the climate will be wrecked and either master asia or char would want humanity out of the picture to restore mother nature
that false canada had its highest recorded temperature during the heatwave and we have records of that going back into the wiki even if it were true it would be irrelevant the fact is climate change had a large part in how bad this heatwave was among many many other things currently happening and expected to happen in the future please educate yourself before spewing bullshit arguments
the common argument is that public transport needs to be improved and roads made more cycle friendly to get people out of cars that still represents a vast investment and in places like somerset where i live it almost unfeasible because of the soft soil most of the roads are high banked lanes like which present challenges for adding cycle lanes and public transport services not to mention the fact that the south west is always an afterthought when it comes to national spending they still have properly fixed the dawlish railway ffs the greens have gone so far as to advocate a zero growth economy to deal with climate change this is a bit like nuclear disarmament because unless everyone else on the planet does the same there very little incentive for anyone to back this

my limited experience with the opiate crisis tells me not much more than our current approach is not working what are the other options and who is unhappy with each one and how does being an ideologue actually help decide if the decision made here by your chosen ideology is the correct one does that also mean that ideology is correct about climate change
sometimes people who do see eye to eye with us can irritate us that pretty normal it very understandable that in this political climate filled with rage and division people on opposite sides of the political aisle would be very friendly the left does bash the right constantly i do agree with you on that but if you allow me i would like to explain to you why the left is so mad rn just to put things in perspective the left feels like the entire institution is corrupt not in terms of private servers but in terms of principles i happen to lean far left and i will would do bash politicians on the right and quite a few supporters so i might not be the best candidate to make you feel better however i just wanna explain that it feels like an attack on freedom freedom of the press freedom of women freedom of sexual orientation discrimination based on religion race etc and i do believe this is why most people on the left are quite angry also they do like the president the point you brought up about diversity is an argument that seems to make sense and it might but here the problem we do not live in an equal society where everyone has the same opportunities if our society was that ideal we would need to press for diversity it would already be a thing why we pushing for representation right now is so we can get to that point where we can just pick people without having to look at those things it is also very important to bring different people to the table those politicians are supposed to represent america and america is more than the one percent more than just the rich and powerful more than just white men it is a pool of diversity and so it is only fair for different people to be represented in the decision making process because those laws afffect them the most they deserve to have someone like them to speak for them i am not trying to make you change parties so please do not misunderstand me i am merely trying to explain my opinion and political affiliation i believe that you are and should always be free to belong to any party you wish and to speak your mind without being bullied an open dialogue would be incredibly beneficial to all parties involved but sadly the current climate makes that quite hard
i understand that those examples were hyperbole but i think you should look and see how many climate change predictions have actually been off that is projections that are actually endorsed by the climate science community organizations like the ipcc i think you will find that climate science has been more or less right on many fronts
we can make people survive in the vacuum of space and we basically able to artificially produce food at this point i not saying life will be good if we do get a handle on climate change but it not the apocalypse we will survive in some form extinction of humans is really on the table

on the plus side the ensuing nuclear winter would cool the earth possibly helping to counteract climate change always look on the bright side of life
nope people are too selfish to do anything and just push the blame onto something else for example let look at diet they put pleasure over the sake of the planet animals and even their own health cooperations blame the plastic straws which make up only of ocean pollution so everyone goes to paper straws and acts like they just saved the planet when in reality they continue buying fish for dinner every week supporting the fishing industry which is one of the leading causes in ocean pollution it also results in the deaths of sharks whales dolphins turtles and more then you have the meat and dairy industry one of the biggest causes of pollution and climate change properganda is shoved down out throats since we were children that we need meat and milk when we simply do the government and the meat industry are in eachothers pockets and so no one is going to tell you to cut out meat because it will severely effect their profits in the uk the government is literally funding pro meat ads and everyone continues to eat mass amounts of meat cheese and eggs these industries have huge effects on our climate but people are selfish they rather push the blame onto other things so they can avoid doing anything more than using a paper straw and turning a light off when they leave a room this applies to many different areas in life people are selfish and do things only for themsleves caring little about anything else they do want to take any accountability and so just blame the huge cooperations dumping waste while compleltey ignoring that for many things it is their own demand for the product that keeps these companies going
i mean for a party who say their housing policy has citizens at the centre they have really provided much more help the housing crisis has been systemic neglect by irish politicians and their inability to extend opportunity outside dublin but fg pretending their somehow a radical party against climate change is laughable
as climate change continues and accelerate the weather patterns will change and areas that are considered marginal for agriculture now will become more and more productive as long as the water is there of course wheat already grows pretty well in montana and the plains provinces of canada but millions of acres will be opened up by warmer temperatures farmers in the dakotas and minnesota already get paid to not farm corn i doubt we going to get a total repeat of the dust bowl the great depression maybe but agricultural advances have come along way since the dust bowl

if the grid is clean car production will be as well while that statement is false it also not entirely true either the raw materials used to make the electronics and batteries for these vehicles are irreplaceable and there is no way to get these resources without massive human exploitation in poorer nations and polluting the local environment capitalism pulled a huge portion of the world out of poverty again a half true statement has capitalism uplifted a billion or two people yes but it also subjugates billions more globally cheap labor in poorer countries with looser worker protections the toppling of governments to install puppet regimes for easier access to natural resources the erosion of environments from deforestation mass farming to climate change leading to mass migration it can and should be used to fix the problems of civilization it ca because it wo we throw away millions of pounds of food from grocery stores because the product has a blemish on it or the container has a dent or because the product reached an by sell by date that has nothing to do with the foods quality or safety for consumption here in the us we have over homeless people in yet we have over vacant homes in this country why does capitalism solve this blatantly easy issue because it not profitable to do so homelessness food insecurity unclean drinking water flint still does have clean water years later mass incarceration exploitation of workers and the crushing of unions all this and more is the byproduct of capitalism
you being naiive fighting climate change is a pretty meaningless statment without context this billion is going into his own charitable foundation which he and his board of directors will over see there plenty of stuff online about how dodgy billionaires charitable foundations are not just in terms of tax write offs either think about how broad fighting climate change is does that billion go to say tackling the systemic issues in the world that have caused us to prioritise economic growth over the enviroment or will it go pie in the sky solutions like carbon capture billion invested in the wrong places can actually do more harm than good and jeff bezos is just a guy how made a very sucesseful online shop who interests are vastly different than of humanity
this is a fact of people could change the amount of pollution at all if you do want corporations pollute do consume wow thanks i guess i just stop using electricity if you can do something to stop pollution do it but at the end the only way to possibly prevent the worst effects climate change under capitalism is worldwide government action
just watched it here are my first thoughts chamalet character had some of the funniest lines in the movie and he executed them well actor of bash ceo was outstanding dicaprio was amazing which did not surprise me at all the news host and the astronaut were also great hill streep and lawrence were decent but forgetable imo the writing and editing in this movie was phenomenal the big short was still more to my liking than this movie but it undeniable that mckay has a great way of inserting his own style in any movie the movie has its hard hitting moments too some of the serious speeches were exceptionally written feels like the plot was predictable at some points pentagon chief that charged money was a great touch that exemplified everything i liked about it the satire and some of the themes are definitely not subtle at all climate change and the pandemic are the super obvious allegory i very much enjoyed how traditional and social media is portrayed in this movie though the actor who called for less fighting made me laugh out loud too but i think the portrayal of the political system and capitalism was a little too on the nose personally it could have been delivered less preachy overall i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone gave it a my favorite satire disaster movie to date
i am a skeptic myself though i am hearing recently that global cooling may be coming the next climate change instead of global warming which you are talking tech environment climate theories crumble as data and experts suggest global cooling other than that if you really want to convince others accept your point of view you have to relate those viewpoint of your s to the issues and topics of which the person you are trying to convince cares about

it is not a single hot day that proves climate change it is the fact that the reason it was so hot was due to an event that should have only happened once in several thousands of years or the fact that for the last decades almost every year has been the hottest year on record
i feel the same towards climate change as well i not a greta fanatic but when i see people trash talking her and the children who are actively trying to make a change all i want to do is slap the critics and remind them that if they would have done better in the past they would nt be scolded at by kids on tv unfortunately if i do try to voice myself i always get someone who tells me to fuck off to the moon if i not happy it angers me but now i know that people troll because some really think they are above all others and i too have been made fun of and discredited about a small spelling mistake before and i ended up making a fool of myself and lost credibility in internet anger another point i try to makr when older generations talk badly about her is remind them of the protest of the vietnam war in the and how that brought change some people are lost causes sadly adapt to change or fall behind in society as i have heard and many already have do give up and play your cards right and you will succeed it all about timing and psychological strategies these days
the people living in poverty today are in that situation as a result of other issues by adding the consequence of an overblown response climate change you push them even further into despair and a lot of people close to that line into the same situation it kinda like saying if poor people already are starving who cares if i pump the price of groceries up
the hard sell here is the nature of adjustments fit confirmation bias of global warming we see over and over again this is a basic problem of science is that if a scientist has a theory and control over adjusting data they will tend to adjust the data to fit the theory assuming that the data is wrong and the theory is right it is for this reason that blind studies occur in medicine to factor out those biases the names of the subjects and details of the subjects are obscured from the people with the theory for global warming you would need an independent panel with no professional stake in the outcome of the measurements in charge of any such adjustments to the data there is no separation no blind in climatology now all of the people involved have professional stake in the outcome of global warming the basic reasons for this are the more severe your problem is the more likely you get funding severe problems receive more public attention and fame and many scientists have gone on record and stand to lose face if they are proven wrong into this mix you toss those who seize upon global warming as a unifying external threat to argue for more power being placed at a multi national body like the un an you have the politicized mess that is called climate change the fact that noaa was caught red handed using sea temperature data from the heat plumes of its vessels in the run up to the paris climate accord to make the sea seem hotter drives home just what a problem we have here while your rational mind may understand concrete island heating making older temperatures seem hotter than before have you seen follow through on the fact that urbanization generates more concrete islands and we have a greater problem with this now and how many of those sensors from recently are adjusted down as well this is the issue they highlight the one rational justification and gloss over all the other things they ignore
denying the developing world cheap and reliable energy in the name of climate change would be quite the sell exactly i do think it so much that no one wants to discuss it i see plenty of people who like to talk about the downsides of serious action as a reason not to do anything i think it more that no one wants to have their name on what happens after even given the alternative as you say good luck selling that and good luck living down the drawbacks
climate change
the price of gasoline is made up of four factors taxes distribution and marketing the cost of refining and crude oil prices of these four factors the price of crude oil accounts for nearly of the price you pay at the pump so when they fluctuate as they often do we see the effects so what does shut down a pipeline costing thousands of jobs and costing more for transportation of the oil from canada to the us fall under because i thinking that distribution so yes presidents can influence gas prices even though not directly controlling them putting aside the fact that this pipeline was causing environmental stories what keystone pipeline not only were most of the jobs lost ie of story news politics keystone pipeline jobs lost joe biden executive order cancel fact temporary jobs unfilled positions the halt of the keystone construction had little to do with the rising gas sites who is to blame for rising gasoline this one a fun one because i think you forgetting that someone that claims to be trans goes by their current gender and not the gender they were born with which can fuck up medical treatments and kill them if a trans person refuses to say what their original birth gender is a doctor should have every right to not treat them because they do want to literally kill them but maybe that just me caring about other people lives more than they care about their own right but not only does it allow medical professionals to deny treatment to trans people but anyone they perceive as trans or trump administration health care discriminate lgbtq i also do not think that denying treatment to a trans person is the solution to the problem you brought up and it definitely is not the only solution but that just me as for the against gay marriage on the topic of same sex marriage trump stated in june that he was for traditional marriage but in stated i think i evolving and i think i a very fair person but i have been for traditional marriage so he changed his mind he grew as a person but for some reason you all holding him to his past words should we do the same for biden and demand he be voted out for being a racist even now you ignoring the fact that trump supported the fada an act that allowed discrimination against lgbtq folk on the basis of freedom of religion you may think that this is a good thing because it protects religious freedom but that kind of thinking was also used by critics of the civil rights act back in the when people believed that religious freedom should allow discrimination of race should we bring back segregation as well because that is what we would essentially be doing by passing that law only it against lgbtq people and not colored people also despite him definitely being a racist biden himself has not passed any legislature at least during his presidency that is harmful specifically to minority communitites that other presidents have not done already in fact he has done many great things for minorities such as passing laws that help prevent asian hate crime and funding minority dominated businesses and colleges while he has one some more than questionable things in the past his current actions are pretty benign at least here in the us that said i completely agree with you that harris was a mistake and that is putting it nicely well gee those numbers sure look different and the second set is from bush jr time want me to look up obama because i can and it show you that it not trickle down economics the math at the highest level is taxed under bush jr and under trump but feel free to do the actual math at the lowest level here a hint you pay more taxes under bush jr with the to your than the under trump for the same amount so not sure where you getting trickle down from as all tax rates were reduced and value ranges were increased under trump individual tax cuts were not the only change caused by this bill i also would like to point out that the individual tax cuts expire in it also dropped the corporate tax rate giving huge gains to the wealthy and big taxes trumps tax reform plan a quote from trump under my plan i be reducing taxes tremendously from percent to percent for companies small and big businesses that going to be a job creator like we have seen since ronald reagan it going to be a beautiful thing to watch oh where to begin with this pile of stupid he said the level the democrats were playing up to was a hoax not that the thing itself was a hoax as for encouraging his supporters to not wear a mask that kind of counters your trump was pretty pro do what you want later on in your post does it after a quick fact check i see he never actually called it a hoax and that is my bad however mocking biden during the debate for wearing a mask mishandling the pandemic disregarding medical professionals and catching covid himself and still playing it off like it is no threat i think it is safe to say that the way he handled this pandemic was horrid as to how him encouraging his followers to not wear a mask is contrary to what i said he said that wearing a mask was necessary and that medical professionals telling people to do so was against freedom ie he was telling people to do what they want even if it threatened other peoples lives for global warming i heard the same crap for at least years about the world ending in years this same shpiel has been repeated since the either we going to die in the next years when scientists and i use that term loosely say this or we wo i leaning toward not so because some science man said that we gon na die in years was wrong that means that climate change is a hoax and we should just ignore it and keep destroying the environment despite it having very visible consequences on us i also feel the need to say that most scientists believe that our ability to do anything about the climate crisis will be out of our reach and will start seriously affecting us in a decade or two not that the world is gon na catch on fire in years and were all gon na die feel free to explain this graph where there is a clear spike in votes for biden when trump gradually grows not every vote was for biden and trump also had similar instances to article uk factcheck wi pa mi vote spikes fact check vote spikes in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania do not prove election fraud does him telling people to do what they want contrary to you saying he encouraged his followers to not wear masks so which is it did he let them do what they want or did he want them to not wear masks also not a whataboutism when it literally what happened i not saying would you be saying the same thing if pelosi was saysing what trump said i saying that people like pelosi and schumer literally said come on down to chinatown here in nyc it safe but you do want to acknowledge that because it goes against your narrative i already addressed this first point and what you doing is literally whataboutism whataboutism also known as whataboutery is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument whataboutism is when you point to a hypothetical situation and ask what i would think if someone who you assume i support would do something i do not like you taking my point about trump underplaying the pandemic and pointing to dems that also did the same thing that is whataboutism
yeah still not seeing your point i well aware how these things change i m not saying english is superior just saying it is still the main international language which is why reddit has grown to be an international website whereas a french website in the same geopolitical climate would struggle to become as widely read not because english is better than french because of history and statistics
no one is taking don cherry seriously about climate change whether he on the right page or not we hardly take him serious about hockey he more a colour commentator and nostalgia than anything these days i been watching him for years
i plan on moving away from utah for other reasons job market housing right now though i have my own anxiety about the air quality because my hometown in california is right by the dixie fire and most of family members have been put on evacuation orders today it never used to be like that over there it makes me really sad to see such a wonderful place on it own get ruined by climate change
republican hypocrisy hits an all time high do you dare talk about climate change or the evils of capitalism but feel free to condemn abortions that not really all that political
good article it does even account for the impact of climate change which exacerbate all factors by you will need at least a way to supplement food water and electricity off the grid and outside of normal channels
science fundamentally disagrees with republicanism on many basic facts of life and reality such as climate change so no of course science articles wo be unbiased because for them to be unbiased towards republicans they would have to deny reality and life in a fantasy world
all scientific data is interpreted within some larger paradigm evidence you see amongst creatures that makes you think common ancestor maybe the same evidence that a theist sees and thinks common designer i am not sure why you think man made climate change is incompatible with christianity given its doctrine of the fall and the dominion mandate evolution is a metaphysical position that goes all the way back to anaximander it paradigm that evidence is interpreted within not one that is determined from just looking at the data and coming to an unbiased conclusion
serious about climate change most climate tree huggers are hypocrites do use anything that needs fossil fuels
climate change is real and we must act now
texas republicans climate change is real texas republicans our privatized energy grid is the envy of the world texas republicans it aoc fault you have icicles on your chandelier
good post op however i will dispute the notion that it conservatism that deserves to die rather than specifically the republican party if you analyse mainstream right wing or conservative parties around the democratic world discounting the european far right parties the gop is particularly notable for its extremism the party extreme stances on guns hostility to climate science and science in general religious fundamentalism glorification of cruelty and ignorance the obsession with trickle down economics catering to special interests even an embrace of white nationalism make it an outlier amongst conservative parties in the democratic world you can not honestly compare angela merkel party and the republican party and say they are the same even though both parties are made up of self described conservatives look at the tories in uk they keep winning elections and are taking actions to mitigate climate change look i am left of centre liberal myself and am not a fan of conservatism however it would be intellectually dishonest to write off the entire movement based on the american example yes the republican party deserves to be destroyed and burnt down to the ground but they are ideologically the most extreme mainstream right wing party in the democratic world and are not at all representative of other conservative parties that not to say there are bad mainstream right wing parties in other countries too however they are still nowhere near as extreme as the gop are
well said i think it more complicated than that and we could point to a confluence of factors the rise of postmodernism leading to a destruction of national pride across the west a sense of utopian individualism the comstamtly re opened wounds that all the redefinition and other language race games postmodernism thrusts to the forefront of debate it all takes up such a significant portion of any meaningful public debate since most of the arguments are not meaningful or productive this becomes a greater and greater problem as we are now beginning to see the harshest ramifications from the expectation of infinite growth take hold corporations have one legal obligation and that is making a profit for their shareholders however investors tend to be finicky and every quarter when the reports come out they tend to make rash decisions when they do see growth so companies are under ever increasing pressure to maximize profits and growth at every quarterly report this is completely unsustainable and some of the actions being taken are like a set of russian dolls of collapse imagine a business taking the money they save with the new tax plan which is always sold to us as something to create jobs and encourage innovation then putting it towards to create ai programs and robotics to replace the costs of labor now think about the fact that every single corporation in the world is spending loads trying to innovate robots and give them the jobs without thinking about just who the hell is supposed to buy their product after a large portion of the lower middle class has been replaced by technology if they are that shortsighted about the fact they are essentially committing suicide to keep up this ridiculous mandate placed on them by the fear of speculator investors driving stock price down and also wield much much more power than one would think because of their advertising deals and shared board memberships on media groups as well as their lobbying power and multinational ties which make corporations the main drivers of trade treaties and agreements then think about their attitude towards climate change or socioeconomic collapse etc their attitude is most likely well if it gon na happen it gon na happen and they buy bunkers and stock them and then go back to their economic shell game while pissing in the stream we drink in meanwhile it hard not to say we complicit as so many have taken up the nonsense fights pushed forth bu our neomarxist college professors who push postmodern masturbatory hypotheses as absolute fact and so many have taken to social media posts as a means for justice which has good intentions but in the end will only make you bitter angry and boxed in thinking no one but your bubble is tolerant or of worth we completely whooshed on the true battle in american politics today a theme throughout the west we see red conservative republican racist blue liberal democrat tolerant and draw battle lines from there when it globalism and the multinational corporations goals to destroy borders to intensify competition in the labor market as a means to drive wages down save on shipping costs and tariffs and move goods more quickly and smoothly and increase market penetration into new countries this is exploitative and fuels their desire for profit at all cost yet they sell it to us as hands across american benevolence tolerance and paint anyone who dare make the logical argument against as xenophobic racist fascist etc versus nationalism and realizing at some point if your priorities do lie with the land you stand on and you rather hinge everything on a ridiculous utopian concept that a country should just let anything and everyone across and give them entitlements not expect them to learn english when most people who say that are gon na learn their language along with everything else that is designed to provoke hate and irrationally to further erode the west to get one step closer to the global system of control that the power players of the world have desired on paper since if that your prerogative so be it it just extremely idealistic for how nihilistic it is at some point reason and acceptance of some consequence should enter the debate but those with the megaphone prevent that actively there something to be said about stability and order these things are at all something i cared for until my when i realized that holy shit christianity actually was the best most effective tool for governing and the benevolent as well compared to the competition nothing is perfect but having the staples be encouraging honestly forgiveness leading by example supressimg envy and resentment and overall being good to one another it hard to argue against it now that postmodernism has taught us to deconstruct and treat biology as a mere construct of society we begun to hate the old guard and most wo ever realize just how destructive that was postmodernism says we can free ourselves from the restraints of the past while also saying that if you white you a racist because of what happened years in the past it absolutely ridiculous and serves as the perfect vehicle for demoralization via education which has been a goal of our enemies for decades but when trump russia gets brought up the media only says russian colluded with trump even after the senate report weeks ago stating no evidence was found of that they still say it not because trump is a piece of shit he is it becuase he not a globalist he wants to put america first he just really bad at everything he does and very good at getting poor people to guffaw at how rich brilliant and self made he is the time and place for chasing utopia is never yet that what has been encouraged and not many sit at home with a worthless social justice gender studies degree or work in service with an education degree and still want to chase their interests without ever facing reality or questioning corporate news unless it does fit their worldview it insane
my feeling is if you want the benefits of living in a society you will almost certainly need to make some sacrifices i see where you coming from though even as someone who supports the switch the green energy the climate change people drive me bonkers personally i recycle because it cheaper tho i enjoy a cleaner trash can amp less flies too same with electricity i turn off the light when i leave the room mostly out of habit i sure do have any illusions about saving the planet but my individuality is expressed by my lifestyle it expressed with how i spend my time amp who i choose to spend it with
this is vhs or betamax this is weighing up the cost of people dying in the future due climate change
i never attributed them to only climate change there has to be ignition i not going to agree with you i barely read your comments anymore however i going to side with the scientists on this one not just some right wing news sources
there is so much more to it than that but yes plastic stares are the purge to examples to show that you can transition away from a specific material in certain cases and things work just as fine with minimal disruption not disrupting what you call the economy should be the first priority after determining what has impacts where because do slow or damage the economy to where people are more worried about income than anything else who gives a shit about the environment a healthy stable economy allows people to focus on other issues because they not worrying about financial stability there a reason why plenty of people say that innovation is the best weapon against climate change because it has been and always will be
news about climate change can be distressing here how to cope with ecoanxiety my partner and i have talked about it heaps and just today we gone and bought a bunch of tofu and we going to phase ourselves into veganism caitlin says i think it is the biggest thing individuals can do to help the environment i really excited about it caitlin grace is becoming a vegan after reading last week ipcc report i never been to a protest before but i now feeling the need to mobilise i keen to get out on the street and be part of it
it not on the front page of any other major media outlet government has withdrawn from any international commitment historically it never taken any major steps outside of handshake agreements china has made any commitments outside of a piecemeal commitment to be carbon neutral by and historically accused the west of leveraging global warming as a vehicle to hamstring their economic development australia has had successive heads of state that said coal was the way of the future or completely ignored any questions pertaining to climate change altogether we treading precariously close to the edge of no return and nothing meaningful is being done still it going to be sad when the oceans start to boil and entire ecological systems collapse but at this point it is more or less a certainty there will be no meaningful change that will prevent this we had years of successive governments doing nothing
vast majority of scientist say that climate change is real and caused by human activity uh no they do that claim has been debunked after examining how the statistics were twisted to craft it that does matter anyway replicability and having projections match reality are what really matter and there been quite a lot of failures on those fronts your refusal to acknowledge those failures and instead plug your ears and screech consensus consensus consensus just reinforces the view that things are on the up and up here again congrats you are part of the problem
this is climate change saying unseasonably warm weather is climate change opens up the door for climate change deniers or whatever the hell they call themselves these days to say well it still snows so obviously climate change is fake we need to look at weather patterns year after year to truly blame climate change i spoken with people in the north who said that as early as the everyone knew down to the week when it would get really cold now they said every year the cold which is essential to permafrost and other parts of the ecosystem is pushed back further and further that climate change if this weather lasts several weeks that should raise some red flags if something similar happens again next year that should raise a lot of red flags throwing around the term climate change does help anyone we need to stick to the science and recognise that climate change is a long term change in weather patterns not a random warm snap in december
so eyes is form of sentience what kind of bs biology have h learnt most living things has a consciousness out of which most plant life is conscious it conscious of its surroundings temperature the climate how do u think we know hw climate change affects flora why do u think plant have defense mechanisms for example the forget me not plant it to prevent it from being eaten from being attacked by loving beings such as yourself just cause you want to anthromorphize all animals as having eyes and ears or some crap like that does mean a tree is not conscious of what happening to it
i think perhaps that some people here are failing to think critically looking at say a public opinion poll on climate change and the public overwhelmingly disagreed with the scientific consensus we would say that there is no fact of the matter rather we probably just say that the public opinion is just fucking wrong do you agree
it too late to curb climate change we need to end and reverse it ban all carbon emissions and find a way to capture as much of it as possible
shove a boot up your ass bootlicker you braindead fools normalize wage slavery the very same economic system you bootlicking fools hold dear is screwing up the planet and i hope that climate change worsens in the following years to force capitalism consumerism to die off while taking you braindead bootlickers with it yes i completely aware i likely die as well
well the warning signs for climate change have been around for decades and we all be underwater before a bunch of tv shows we wo watch get aired so we can complain about stuff we not doing
the entire conversation on climate change is religious in nature the whole point of my argument is that people were illiterate in the middle ages and reliant on authority for religious instruction and information about the workings of the world people today are scientifically illiterate unaware of how badly compromised science has been through government and corporate funding the inefficacy of the peer review process etc there has always been climate change and always will be the irony is that the climatologists favoured by authority have been arguing or implying climate had been in equilibrium prior to the industrial this includes efforts to remove the medieval warm period from history etc it is possible mankind has had more of an impact on climate than i am aware but it is a fact that carbon emissions are not the cause most climatologists have comprehensive opinions on climate change and cite an array of factors responsible some very prominent climatologists have pushed back against climate alarmists only to be attacked ad hominem atheists argue religion makes people bad religious people argue it makes them good i am saying both groups are shitty because people are people religions are not hostile towards their own followers the exception being contrarians who challenge authority religions are hostile towards foreign or competing it similar to nationalism sectarianism is mostly a cycle of escalating retribution religion is one source of these conflicts to be sure
what we have to know about biology along with the infrastructure we need to apply it has massive implications for developing other things whereas we technically have the technology to prevent climate change already it just expensive
speeding up warming effects of climate change to own the libs
i eat meat only removes an animal whose farts contribute to global warming while leaving our precious plants in place to filter out carbon dioxide i doing my part to fight climate change though it is easy mind if i add you
it not the tsunamis you need to be worried about as the ice melts in the poles methane is released from the permafrosts which adds to the greenhouse effect which leads to higher global temps which leads to more methane escaping which means it a climate change feedback loop
if it has the potential to impact the entire nation or world ie anything to do with the environment the state should not be handling it because their decisions will impact a lot more than themselves for example in canada the supreme court just ruled that a carbon tax was legal to be imposed on the provinces that do want one because climate change impacts the entire country
you first need to show how that proves he denies climate change
you do have to coin it with the term liberal i am probably not going to vote because i have gotten my ballot and i have other things in my life to worry about i personally not excited for biden but i do want someone who is a little more mature in office i tired of the asshole in chief going on coked our am twitter rants and insulting anyone that does agree with him not mentioning trump though it seems like his administration will take climate change seriously i sure he not going to put complete idiots in charge of offices who cares if he a puppet i tired of constant denial and blatant corruption by our current administration
look i know it hard to admit but you wrong there are no credible studies to say overpopulation is an actual problem climate problem or any problem there are no studies you can point to you assumption based on you personal experience and understanding does change the facts
nan
the moderate side of the republican party still opposes lgbt rights police reform climate change action welfare spending universal healthcare universal education and other stuff they bring nothing to the table besides as another roadblock towards progress i do think any politician in america is supporting what you are claiming the democrats support so i do think it an accurate description
yes it has asserting the opposite and citing sources funded by the fossil fuel industry does not refute the reality of the scientific consensus it matters if human activity and altering human activity can have a material impact on climate change get a load of this first the denial was of it happening at all then it became denial that it was human caused now it is denial that humans can have an impact on changing it desperate holding actions to protect their profits it is sad they have deluded people like you
the article you linked does claim anything close to in major cities drowning into the ocean you completely misinterpreted that you also ignore land being made available for agriculture but more importantly even if everything you say was true which it is australia ca prevent climate change on their own even if they reduce emissions by other countries wo and climate change will still happen except now australia are in a depression and are too poor to deal with all their cities drowning into the ocean on the other hand if they abandon all climate policy in pursuit of higher growth at least they have more resources in the future to be able to deal with the effects of climate change
except that liberal is something you are born as no they learn it in liberal echo chamber of colleges show liberal you would say we need more climate scientists who do believe in manmade climate change even though over of the field believes in it right now i do understand enough about climate modeling to be comfortable giving an opinion with that said climate change has become something super politicized to the point that is hard to get real unbiased research on it so it probably would hurt to finance researchers that do believe in man made climate change and then compare the two research bodies in hopes that we could maybe sift through our biases treat social sciences the same way instead of wishing more people would study the evidence in depth and decide to agree with you maybe try listening to the conclusions they drawn from that evidence you see the problem is i ca i understand human nature and i know we tend to be biased just imagine the bubble of confirmation bias that social sciences researchers live in when social psychologists are almost all liberals and its really hurting the of their peers hold the same beliefs diversity of opinion should be welcomed in science nobody is free from american liberals are just as biased as conservatives study
well first off we do hate cars we hate car dependent society aka a society that forces or encourages people to use cars which is what we currently have in most of the us but there a few reasons car infrastructure and sprawling suburbs are bankrupting us the cost to maintain roads and infrastructure to car dependent suburbs is immense and is not recouped by the people living there us in the city are subsidizing rich suburbanites not to mention businesses that are built around cars like malls drive through places and fast food all cost more and make less for the city than dense urban businesses like our old downtowns and they less stable too we are currently bleeding money on cars and we should be they bad for the environment even electric cars are great although they better than gas cars if we want to tackle climate change we need to move away from cars and towards walking biking and public transit these are all significantly better for the environment both globally and locally then cars thousands of people die from poor air quality every year because of car emissions even in the us they bad for us cars are incredibly unsafe especially for pedestrians over a million people are killed by cars every year and driving is one of the most dangerous things you ever do it stressful and scary and puts people in a bad mood which makes crashes even more likely the fact we drive everywhere rather than walking or biking is also terrible for us there a reason the world is so fat today and one of the main ones is the lack of exercise i rather bike everywhere if i could but i ca because my city is so car centric and spread out ideally it be even faster than driving like it is in some european cities lastly they atomized out society we lack the sense of community humans have had for thousands of years because we do see our neighbors anymore we do pass them on the street or run into them at the corner store we all lonely and stuck in our little bubbles and isolated from each other is it any wonder people lack empathy nowadays there more reasons then just these but if i listed them all my comment would fit lol if you want to learn more a great place to start is not just bikes on youtube he has a playlist of videos about a group called strong towns that i highly recommend and basically spells out all the problems with car centric development it really interesting
excerpt but surviving is the same as recovering the losses from business disruption after a disaster often dwarf the losses in the event itself we will need power water and businesses up and running to chart our path to recovery we have been making strides toward such resilience the los angeles department of water and power began a major seismic resilience program in to protect our water supplies southern california edison has established a seismic resiliency program working to protect the electric grid but back to our buildings because we have considered decisions about the financial risk of earthquakes to be a matter of personal choice our life safety building codes ask only that a building not kill its inhabitants after a quake the building that did crush you may nonetheless be a total loss built to meet the bare minimum of the codes to save every possible penny in construction models of a big earthquake on the southern san andreas fault estimate that as many as of the high rises designed to the current code in downtown los angeles miles from the fault will be so compromised they will have to be torn down after the earthquake our physical lives will have been spared but our economic lives could well be in tatters assembly bill currently making its way through the california legislature would change this outcome and give us what most of us think or at least hope we are already getting from the building codes homes and offices that can be repaired and returned to use our economy can not recover after an earthquake if we do not have places to work or live ensuring that the way we build now wo bake in trillions of dollars in future losses is i believe the most important step we can take to protect the economic future of california the need for functional recovery rather than merely life safety building codes has been recognized for some time the magnitude christchurch earthquake in new zealand where buildings were constructed to the same standards and with much the same techniques as california showed the problem no one there died in a modern building yet structures had to be torn down christchurch recovered because more than of its buildings were covered by earthquake insurance we know from state insurance data that fewer than of our buildings have that protection a recent report from the federal emergency management agency and the national institute of standards and technology recommended that states with a high seismic risk should enact functional recovery building codes to protect the economy at the local regional and national level california with the highest earthquake risk of all states should lead the way in resilience just as we have in combatting climate change we did not wait for federal or global action on climate change and we have seen the benefits in jobs revenue and overall economic vibrancy we will save more money in the long run than we will have to spend up front because building stronger does not cost that much more functional recovery standards are estimated to add only to in building costs a fraction of the cost of rebuilding after a total loss but until the code requires all projects to meet that standard most builders wo make the investment after all they sell the building and the future losses are someone else problem
my wife amp i are older millennials life has been kind to us and we are financially quite comfortable for our generation i started off on the left now i somewhere around feed billionaires to the homeless that a trend for a lot of millennials we are keeping on trend with past generations i think a lot of it is that republicans have been viciously attacking anyone on the left for my entire adult life longer really i know i have got a home there even if i wanted to go which i do i think a significant majority of millennials know and care about at least one person most of us have student loan debt most of us have struggled to get into home ownership or have yet and many of us will never have a hope of it many of us have had to delay parenthood and many of us have no hope of being parents without condemning ourselves to eternal poverty most of us are concerned about climate change most of us do expect ever to be able to retire many of us maybe most are working more than one job most of us are underpaid and in all of those categories every single one republicans are against us our entire lives have been shaped by republicans either through negative actions or through preventing positive democratic actions via gridlock and bullshit we not watching fox news average age of fn viewer is around so we not getting brainwashed so where the fuck is the incentive to change
i suspect they cut that shit out when the schools started complaining about losing of their tuition now they privately spew shit and even within their own ranks there are people who have noticed zero change in our climate other than the usual el nino el nina but they silenced immediately look at all these government funded faa programs that just free money i doubt the faa can do better research than nasa but even nasa has their hands in the cookie jar
the dog stars by peter heller is excellent it a pandemic that sets off the collapse in that one though climate change plays a part too great post apocalyptic action bleak and beautiful descriptions of the natural world reasons for despair and hope a love story and recognition of the futility of it all one of my favorite books of the last years
i think there a difference between praising intellectualism for all its navel gazing theoretical arguments and warning of the problem of anti intellectualism where people with no experience in a highly complicated field decide that all experts in that field are wrong evidence be damned that how we get things like creationism anti vaxxers crystal healing climate change denial etc etc
he wo his stance is that climate change simply does exist he has acknowledged climate change is a thing but that it not as big of a deal as people are making it out to be might not even be caused by humans and because so might not be as easily deterred instead he has focused on much clearer and tangible problems
i have scrolled down far enough to see if anyone has mentioned arizona and climate change some places in arizona already get so hot that one could die if you are not moving from air conditioned space to air conditioned space this will become more severe and aside from what the other posters wrote is also a consideration
except you not taking into account possible technological developments that could affect or reverse climate change in the future secondly your assumption of the netherlands having received the mehdi is incorrect because the quote implies a more widespread worldwide change whilst the netherlands is a tiny country with a population of probably of the city i live in there also the fact that people overestimate how happy these countries are it quite hard to quantify happiness anyway and forget that the success of these countries rest upon trillions of dollars worth of stolen colonial resources and lives of luxury built upon the oppression of people in other countries doing labor for next to nothing in other words i do think it dated tbh if anything people are bound to get tired of being oppressed by the corrupted capitalist system in place today and when that happens is the day we see true wealth redistribution
never heard of this person dumb though it not about the vaccine i got the shot it about your freedoms being stripped away i stand with anyone who chooses for themselves what best for them not the government keep following blindly people climate change mandates coming soon
in the pnw you legitimately only need ac for a handful of days per year installing a central ac system is really cost effective when you maybe get degree temperature days each summer it also not humid here and the temperature drops quite a bit at night so if you open all your windows and use fans your house will really cool off i lived in the midwest for a number of years and pretty much every house has ac because it definitely worth the cost with how warm the summers consistently are a lot of folks do have portable ac units i have actually but they are only so effective especially if you have an entire house to cool off with multiple bedrooms i think most newer houses probably have a heat pump installed during construction which is more efficient heating in the winter which is more important here and provides central ac but most older homes maybe even homes around years old definitely did have central ac installed when constructed it really just was worth the cost or did exist so in order to have ac you have to pay to have it installed which is cheap the housing market is already really outrageous here so folks who rent definitely are paying to have central ac put in that being said i foresee more people myself included looking into getting some form of central ac as degree whether is just so miserably uncomfortable to deal with and unfortunately with climate change i do see summers cooling off
that whole area is going to get very interesting over the next decade china is building a relationship with the taliban china and india are at odds over their border pakistan lost a lot of importance to the us when the us withdrew from afghanistan pakistan and the taliban are in a growing conflict including pakistani air strikes into afghanistan pakistan and india are always saber rattling while also being nuclear powers india and pakistan are also front and center of an unfolding climate change disaster with heat waves and lack of rain making the future look less than ideal
hi brian i have heard that the soil in part through the actions of trees can act as a source of carbon sequestration has any of your research focused on this subject have you seen any changes in this mechanism with climate change thanks for your time
whereas i appreciate the support she has gathered for climate change i listen to someone who has finished their basic education regarding how to combat it scientist little girl
the scientists were right climate change is just a conspiracy by the hippies
i pretty sure they actually do believe in climate change
they trying to make everything political every single news headline needs to come down on the left or the right climate change effects us all but no only liberals care about it election security effects us all but no it must be some sort of advantage for liberals to win elections the president is clearly breaking the law but no he our guy so we must support him no matter what it absolute lunacy
hate her most likely the right wingers on this site which there are a lot of do like her because she a a young woman who has a strong opinion on stuff and does really appeal with the losers because she does agree with their opinions on things like climate change and trump being an asshole then the other parts of reddit which can be described as libertarians or brogressives hate her because she do throw climate change as something caused by world countries but the excessive consumption of world countries this ruffles their jimmies because they do expect their lifestyles to be directly criticized with a dash of misogyny mixed in on the basis of how dare a girl become a large part of a moment
dude never said it was climate change that something you assumed
no it can not the only thing that separates an alarmist from anyone else that acknowledges the reality of climate change is they want to fix the very obvious glaring problem faster the alarmist is still right about needing to make drastic changes in order to prevent a catastrophic future
the war in syria has been against the people and the gov as the gov have been bombing civilian buildings even the usa is guilty of this my one friend is a refugee from syria told me all about it had little to do with their resources and more to do with a dictatorship that the people do nt want look up what syria looked like before the war it was literally a paradise even before the conflict began many syrians were complaining about high unemployment corruption and a lack of political freedom under president bashar al assad who succeeded his father hafez after he died in in march pro democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of deraa inspired by the arab spring in neighbouring countries when the government used deadly force to crush the dissent protests demanding the president resignation erupted nationwide the unrest spread and the crackdown intensified opposition supporters took up arms first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces mr assad vowed to crush what he called foreign backed terrorism the violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war i not saying you are wrong one day i sure it will be directly the case of climate change but for now not so much
i never said i doubted science and your straw man attempt is predictable let me guess you have a degree in science related field first you stated scientific consensus on global warming the problem is when science politics money power control all cross paths example used to be global cooling then global warming now climate change yet not a single scientific study has enough raw data not theoretical data to track global climate cycles for more than a couple hundred years any data beyond that is theoretical or speculative in your lifetime or mine unless we chronicled worldwide data and charted it out we would have no personal reference or value to add to the debate and even if we did it would be irrelevant in its isolation so a lifetime or or are not enough to have scientific consensus now there are scientific studies that are empirical and not debatable i call that science everything outside that is not conclusive but much of it is good theoretical science worth discussing
realistically mid orange oops is a disaster that kills millions and gets attributed to climate change
but that does fit the climate change agenda
we discussed a theory in my concepts of wilderness class that in order to facilitate change the extremes of the spectrum need to be expanded in order to make some of the most important environmental issues seem less extreme and more palatable to the general public but it can sometimes backfire and cause the masses to disregard environmentalism altogether but yea i think more and more people are jumping to the extreme sides of things because of our current tumultuous political climate

climate change is real it is also being used by politicians and corporations as a scheme to squeeze money out of us to enrich themselves instead of truly dealing with the issue in good faith for the common good
cheaper half measures that simply wo be enough and it so much cheaper to begin dealing with climate change now than when we are forced to deal with mass migration and food shortages throughout the globe how is this not clear as day
if nothing else reddit will be a good historical record of how complacent and outright stupid the average american was in regard to catastrophic climate change
so let me get this right you are saying because stem graduates are studying hard science then their political applitudes are more reflective of intelligence thinking well speaking as an engineering graduate from uw one of the top canadian university for engineering let me tell you even in stem field most people here care about actions on climate change health coverage all of these stances that makes us left leaning
climate change will make it not enough room island
he says global warming is a hoax that shows he is willing to throw science under the bus to appeal to his base just like every other gop candidate i have no confidence in him to to invest in green energy he wo push for it he wo fight for it sure he might give some lip service but when it comes down to it i do have confidence in him to fight climate change it much easier for him to throw it under the bus and blame it on the chinese
it really is amazing how agw has become a political issue because the republican party decides to avoid discussions about how to mitigate it and what economic losses are acceptable to ensure the survival of humanity so they pretend the whole thing is real and their base goes along with it for some reason no other conservative party i can think of is this uniformly opposed to climate change being a thing we have to fix i would say american libertarians but they just republicans who like weed and do care about religion
that where you make your mistake is high on the list but it is not the only ghg that scientists want to see controlled that why for example they have been working on ge livestock and animal feed production to reduce the amount of methane produced by farmed animals while you are absolutely right the crowd that the most vocal on climate change is also the same crowd that the most vocal against gmo or nuclear energy i do think they realize that they demonize the solution just as much as they demonize the problem
i read the papers in the morning but i also start with my usual question when someone just bare cites a handful of papers what specific parts of the argument which you find ultimately pursuasive do you think each of these papers does for you in every paper i published the references come with a literature review section that at least tries to weave together a story they do just stand on their own ipcc report i read most of the last three ipcc reports i found them pretty solid on climate science we can collapse the forcing function down to mostly one dimensional estimate a wide range of scenarios for this parameter which comes out of the fast dynamics so this is an assumption but not an insane one and get a pretty good idea of how the slow system responds i found them vastly less convincing on economic estimates and they predict surprisingly small effect sizes i could go see if i can find some of the quotes but i recall single digit percent gdp losses in hard hit areas which are easily dwarfed by uncertainty i already quoted david roberts ridiculing them on mitigation estimation the latest such analysis is the ipcc assessment on mitigation of climate change which has people confidently asserting that properly addressing climate change will trim percent a year off global gdp growth not a year not but do you have any particular estimates in mind from ipcc that you find particularly relevant both in terms of methodology uncertainty and in terms of impact size
that not really how it works climate change affects weather patterns in winter too global warming is the previous name that low info detectors jump on to say it got warmer in the name but it still cold disproved warming of the oceans and poles changes weather patterns in the jet streams including bringing abnormal cold we just call it polar vortex i the cold instead of heat dome
one will have a more correct view for how to construct a more just society opinions do have correct views i feel comfortable saying that if you do support these movements you are morally wrong that not to say that the practical nature for addressing them is up for debate but their implementation is not what the republican platform is rather republicans i will concede this point morally i think it is wrong to have a denying view of global warming however republicans by nature are the people wary of change this is by design that they act as the balance against rapid change that democrats like opposed marriage equality and most other social movements if you ask a republican what their opinion on gay marriage is most will be fine with it most people do give a fuck the people who do are religious republicans plus as backwards as it may sound now when gay marriage was being considered to be legalize could you say with exact certainly what the ramifications would be continually act to sell public lands and deregulate the fossil fuel industry while i too am opposed to fossil fuels i do understand the point that republicans make people would lose jobs now we have stats saying it would make more jobs then before but in the renewable sector but republicans as the wary people they are were concerned that their was no guarantee that number would stay consistent unlike fossil fuel industry that was from a perspective consistent literally do even believe climate change exists yeah i got nothing for this one i totally believe they are in the wrong but it more wrong to try and silence them for it like the poem goes first they came for the socialists and i did not speak out because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me effectively support the current system of healthcare as a market you have to understand that for most republicans the idea of paying someone elses medical bill is insane why do you have to pay when you never receive that benefit which bring us to the last point reject most social programs using rather than academic or philosophical works propaganda about individualism most republicans are middle class and up they do see anything from the payments they make to social programs because why the fuck should they now how do i know that our current social systems are unfair because i am an years old white dude and have never owned a phone my family has a rule that if you want a phone you pay for it yourself meanwhile my friend tony who is black and lives in easily the lower class has a government provided smartphone is my friend lying i do know maybe but that not the point where s my smart phone from the programs where was social welfare when my relative was literally eating food from dumpsters
i really like ezra klein but he has a few blind spots that really irk me one of those being the darker side of this quote veganism is not a political conversation it manifests in some really problematic ways for instance he had an episode about the climate crisis and never once did he ask his guests about animal ag despite the fact that experts concur that we can not solve the climate crisis without addressing that industry he not wrong in his hesitations right after that quote he talked about how much the right lost their shit at the lie that biden was going to limit their beef intake that kind of response to veganism in the political discourse definitely has the potential to harm progress but there a difference between pushing veganism onto people politically enacting a law banning burgers for example and having veganism be part of the political conversation it is one of the largest contributors to climate change in adopting this mentality i fear klein too often avoids the latter because of his distrust of the former
climate activists are going to need to figure out whether they want to fix the climate problem or turn everyone into socialists you could probably tackle climate change if you were sincere about wanting to do that but if it just a socialism gateway that will be a much harder sell
that also happens at r trashy where someone will make a post about politicians who deny climate change like really i wanna see broken families at walmart not corny soapbox posts
robinson also reaffirms personal views on climate change that became a major issue in the election guess what most of the people of north carolina know global warming is junk science he writes probably because they did get quality science education starting in first grade
i think the word you looking for is neoliberalism neoliberalism is the cause of this marriage between corporations and countries climate change warfare and authoritarianism disguised as utilitarianism are its products
yeah only one side is denying climate change only one side is in a war with facts sure dems have not been fully honest but they do dispute scientific fact
no one is basing their climate change opinion on the word of candace owens she a political activist not an intellectual or scientist
the harm locusts cause has certainly been exacerbated by climate change due to cyclones made more intense by climate change causing favorable breeding conditions but locusts have been a pest for as long as agriculture has been around and to ascribe all of their damage to climate change is inaccurate

the chart is the carbon absorption rates of various parts that make up the biosphere heat equivalence where the carbon goes the potential heat goes i sorry that was clear
those who are most effected by climate change are the developing nations and younger and future generations they have least contributed to the problem and they did not consent to be put at risk economic arguments can not be used as ethical justification for the continued and increasing harm of others so rather than whining you need to grin and bear it
but told me climate change is a scam made up by china
on the grounds that them increasing their standard of living will in the end reduce the standard of living of myself my fellow countrymen and future generations including their own children if canada can produce car for half the emissions as china then canada should produce the car that makes the most sense there nothing wrong with china improving their standard of living if they can do so using less emissions also if you are prepared to deny others the ability to increase their standard of living when doing so is carbon intensive then you are prepared to actually tackle the issue of climate change the only other solution to tackling climate change is to innovate a way to both increase standards of living and reduce emissions in a manner that is more productive than fossil fuel sources this is the ideal solution but it currently does appear to be possible so it a very risky solution

most people here will tell you all of this is a massive conspiracy by the western powers to maintain their chokehold on world countries others will say the whole point of this was to create a massive green industry amp lobby if you are looking for the truth follow the money the truth is the western powers that are investing in said green industry are actually losing an enormous amount of money in the process today it is much cheaper to produce electricity through nuclear power plants coal plants because you can regulate the amount of electricity produced at all times to match the demand which you ca do with solar or windmills and this is only one example amongst many in short no one is benefiting from this situation rich countries in europe are litteraly pouring billions into an ecological transition because science seems to indicate this is necessary if trump had more than a pea sized brain he would listen to the usa very own scientific institutions which are unanimously calling for action on this without anything to earn in doing so for example nasa litteraly has nothing to gain in saying climate change is real and is a threat to our civilization if anything under the trump presidency they risk having their fundings cut but they do what good scientists do state the findings of their research factually people will say nasa are fabricating altering their raw data they have officialy explained their reasons for altering said raw data if you are interested in learning why once again ask yourself why would they go through such lengths to prove climate change is real under the presidency of one of the biggest climate deniers of our time finally i will say this if you want to know the truth the devil is in the detail look at official un reports reports from independant associations such as wpf greenpeace official reports from various nations on the subject look at the frequency of wildfires in areas where they have been a known phenomenon in the past ex california look at the frequency of ski stations closing down in europe are they benefiting from this too and how year after year you have to go higher up to find good snow over the last years look at the increase in heatwaves etc is this man made is this just a passing phenomenon we all have a choice to make here but what is at stake is much more than a few hot summers most of the scientifc community worldwide seems to agree this is a phenomenon that arrises from anthropic activity but hey maybe they are all in the loop too at the end of the day the question you need to ask yourself is how much are you willing to bet they are wrong
most of the examples the author used a re caused by consumerism the reason people aleays want new stuff and are never satisfied is propaganda fed to us that makes us think we do not have enough the joy then comes from the act of purchasing not from having theproduct you desired just because our society is like this does mean all societies that have ever existed or will exist have to be as well and the we live better than kings in the past argument is not true for a lot of people especialy on the colonized world but with climate change and ecological destruction looming on the horizon i have to agree that post scarcity will not be reached for a pretty long time if at all
climate change deniers are wrong but the democrats have not proposed smart enough legislation to support as pointed out above by you can find facts for both sides of this debate that will support either side it a stalemate of course if you only frequent liberal rags and tumblr you will never see the other side and this is just i do even know be a bit more specific
it is technically accelerated due to climate change and other factors but i agree it probably would nt change if not be set back to about minutes so set back seconds
take that climate change
he did he been giving the same response on that for a year and he wrote something similar in his book his response is generally about comparing what a job requires with what you have to offer and seeing if there a good match he correctly identified that there was a demand in the party for pragmatic progressives particularly those from the middle of the country where the party has lost so much ground in the past two decades and correctly identified that the party is looking for new leadership as the previous group now are cresting into their durbin is schumer is around pelosi is biden is sanders is hoyer is there a wide recognition that new ideas new approaches and new people are needed to make necessary change democrats need to re expand our coalition to include the working class people we been losing to the republicans and pete plans are crafted in ways that let us do that without compromising the solutions themselves if you give these people who otherwise might support republicans some tangible benefits for crossing over and incorporate them into the solution instead of labeling them as the problem such as with soil management solutions to help fight climate change or by expanding protections for at risk rural healthcare facilities we can expand the party retake majorities in both chambers and get some actual progressive policy passed but only if we build a large coalition to do it that extends beyond the coasts
i just got a cheap one by some chinese brand called luxcoms it does use drivers it just has a button to change the colors on the side technically it does even need to be plugged into the pc then but there is no off switch beyond turning off of or putting your pc to sleep not that a whole watts of power is gon na prevent climate change
a no they not some are some are b irrelevant models are not used as evidence for climate change
until people like central bankers realise how badly we will be fucked up by climate change and start to act we going nowhere to me that makes this very positive news
here an unbiased chart for you you will notice that the charts are the same i can even find the link to the government webpage itself if you ask nicely the interpretation on the previous link is very liberal oriented but it not a bias if it correct the truth is that ever since reagan the republicans have been driving up the national debt at obscene rates and the only president that put a dent in it was clinton that is an objective fact in this matter like most others you will find that reality and facts have a liberal bias i not a democrat i do associate myself with any political party i got a few bones to pick with the current administration namely regarding the ndaa edward snowden and the lack of any meaningful action against the nsa illegal mass surveillance program that being said bush did much worse typically i agree with democrats more than republicans because most of the time they right or at the very least less wrong republicans at the end of the day talk big but rarely have a shred of evidence to back their absurd theories up their entire platform is based on appeals to ignorance and mindless propaganda we do know climate change is real only of scientists agree if you do support the patriot act and sending our boys overseas to die you an anti american terrorist sympathizer uneducated fundamentalists agree that vaccines cause autism and homosexuality breaking news is obama the antichrist or just a well disguised kenyan bushman find out tonight at on faux news where it been objectively proven by fact checkers that of everything we say is false ironically you have demonstrated this admirably by challenging my source without providing any of your own not even so much as a faux news page just a few rantings and ravings about how this page ca possibly be right because it paints the gop in a bad light if you had bothered to look this shit up and verify it yourself instead of instantly dismissing because it threatened your false perceptions of reality you would have found the same thing i did so where the fuck are your sources buddy
greenhouses keep levels at about go walk into one you will breathe just fine i was talking about the long term because at this rate earth may be uninhabitable in a matter of a few thousand years i was hoping that would convince you we should stop polluting but if you want to talk about the short term i can do that too in the short term the planet is a few degrees celsius warmer that does seem like a lot until you consider how much energy that is over the entire fucking planet the intense global dust storms on mars like the one that totaled the opportunity rover drop the planet average temperature by about degrees celsius we talking about storms that blot out the sun making the noon day sun darker than midnight for months at a time across most of the planet it turns out earth is going through changes nearly as extreme who cares of it degrees warmer you might ask to which i would reply because weather heat drives every part of weather adding more of it makes all kinds of weather more extreme and natural disasters more common this changes existing weather patterns in ways we are equipped to deal with cheaply heat also melts the poles which contain enough frozen water to submerge many costal cities in the short term climate change activism is all about economics what is cheaper upgrading energy infrastructure or rebuilding the cities nature decides to anally fuck
scientific theory is a explanation in accordance with the scientific method its not a fact it uses facts like the temperature of earth is slightly increasing and the fact of pollution then they make a educated guess based on scientific methods that are not factual this is the problem with climate change so many people are uneducated on the topic
lol you just took a question about credibility and pivoted right into your climate change bullshit how many shekels are you getting to shill your politics in every answer
i also think that people are starting to really understand the fragility of life in ways that they have never before so now people who were working full time and can afford to be comfortable if they quit are suddenly downsizing and quitting and planting gardens prioritizing family people who are less financially stable or have to take two part time jobs because they have been made redundant might suddenly feel extremely despairing if they are also single and do not have any sort of support in a partner and there are people who discovered that they ca could never count on their partners those people are also unhappy also from here out we looking at a few years of an ongoing cold war hopefully just a cold war and recession maybe depression we looking at values changing very rapidly we looking at massive massive instability i do think the last few generations have been trained to handle this in the ways that perhaps our great grand parents may have been trained boomers gen x gen y and the millennial generation were raised to expect that if we worked hard enough we could have anything our children could have anything unfortunately this is not true the only people who gained financially during the pandemic are the the people most affected are women who have held the majority of unstable incomes jobs and now have no jobs because no one can afford childcare any more so women become free labor some people think that after the recession we will get hedonism like it the i think they forget that natural resources in the were more abundant than they are today climate change is going to has already the cost of basic living if anything people are going to become more insular and traditional cottagecore has already become a fashion especially as less people see the point in going to university and in ten years the woke generation is going to be subject to okay boomer memes but instead it will be okay gen z if we still have memes because the only thing that is free is love i think many single people are very lonely at this time
km is miles so miles over the recommended amount is not good in fact many manufacturers had to pull back their numbers when they release a or mile service interval i heard mercedes techs claim you have to be crazy to got miles on a change and subarus were burning too much oil to make the lol if you live in a fucked up climate like ohio go for synthetic for conventional and of course if your car uses oil in between changes top it off accordingly

simple question how do we get to a point where the environment is protected and our future is secure let say for the sake of argument that the planet is indeed in imminent peril from climate change i tend to buy that idea but i also old enough to remember previous climate catastrophes that were support to kill us all and that never amounted to anything when i was a teenager we were all sure the hole in the ozone layer was going to kill us all by saturating the planet with harmful ultra violet solar radiation that never happened let say i believe this is an existential threat to our existence very well then how do we solve it what the answer accurate science and open sharing of knowledge is a good thing but science alone wo solve this problem i have some ideas on how i approach this but i like to hear what others think
this is interesting and i could buy it but for some exceptions conservatives reject the idea of systemic racism and climate change despite the fact they are described in the terms of a palpable enemy the other is that trump described himself as a wartime president early and covid was treated as an enemy and then it quickly became a conspiracy i think it may be that when the language of palpable enemy is used conservatives can still buy into a conspiracy that they merely only be led to believe it an enemy
they do military releases reports about how threatening climate change is for example
scientific american myths perpetuated by climate change deniers claim anthropogenic ca be changing climate because is only a trace gas in the atmosphere and the amount produced by humans is dwarfed by the amount from volcanoes and other natural sources water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas so changes in are irrelevant claim the alleged hockey stick graph of temperatures over the past years has been disproved it does even acknowledge the existence of a medieval warm period around that was hotter than today is therefore global warming is a myth claim global warming stopped a decade ago the earth has been cooling since then claim the sun or cosmic rays are much more likely to be the real causes of global warming after all mars is warming up too claim climatologists conspire to hide the truth about global warming by locking away their data their so called consensus on global warming is scientifically irrelevant because science is settled by popularity claim climatologists have a vested interest in raising the alarm because it brings them money and prestige claim technological fixes such as inventing energy sources that do produce or geoengineering the climate would be more affordable prudent ways to address climate change than reducing our carbon footprint all throughly debunked and documented by scientific american here
venezuela is better in mitigating climate change than its neighbors

also the fact that the chances of actually communicating with an extraterrestrial life form are slim to none even though the universe is more than likely teeming with life by teeming i of course take into account how massive the universe is it probably not super common but it has to be there the distance and limitations of technology keep life from contacting life so basically we will always be alone even if life is present elsewhere in our milky way galaxy also the chances of us ever leaving the solar system a spaceship like the enterprise are slim to none mainly none the closest star system would take over a hundred thousand years to reach with our best technology so get comfy enjoy the next billion years or so until our sun gets so bright and hot that life will start to become impossible ps pray we do get hit by a rogue asteroid comet or the death rays of a pulsar or a solar flare so massive it blows away our atmosphere or the moon gets destroyed people think climate change is fake sure space is big and could give a fuck what you think this planet is all we may ever get and everything we have ever known everyone we love could end suddenly in a fiery blast sleep tight

rich and western countries love shitting on china and india regarding pollutiin and climate change but they the west have higher per capita emissions this is really like people who wo give up the convenience of a private car and then tells asthmatics that your inhaler is a greenhouse when relative to non inhaler pollution inhaler contribution is like if all asthmatics stop taking their greenhouse inhaler it even wo make a dent
it technically true the climate has never been static it was changing as soon as there was something you could call a climate but it also complete bullshit in that we the only significant variable for climate change on human timescales in the present the only reason to engage in that pedantry is to cloud the issue and deny the need for action
i think comment is the essential thing at this moment it also important to remember that imperial hostility and interference did start recently venezuela has rarely been free of it spain continued to try to recapture venezuela even after the long war of independence aided by the us uk etc among many other punishments and instances of aggression over the centuries by blockades fomenting coups outright military aggression and so on venezuela still carries the marks of that colonial history for example in its racially correlated unequal distribution of wealth especially in land and odious foreign debt its popular indigenous movements throughout the late century and especially since made progress in overcoming some of that though series sipovginiven has decreased and its human development sites default files country profiles has increased especially education and life expectancy only starting to drop sharply with the latest sanctions obviously venezuela has problems the importance of oil in its economy does make it vulnerable it has a number of environmental issues many attributable to climate change its political and economic institutions are perfect but it a stretch and i actually say pretty meaningless to say that all due to socialism taken as a whole venezuela is an incomplete example of socialism at the policies institutions that could be called socialist have been positive on balance do think too much should be made of hdi it an imperfect measure and ca be used as the sole indicator of success but it not nothing this probably gets a dismissive mocking hurr not real socialism response when it brought up but it legitimate we ca just unquestioningly accept a that any concrete thing labeled socialism is and can be used to judge socialism as a concept or program and b that complex situations or problems with many different causes can be attributed broadly to socialism and left at that
jesus christ you on the ecology soapbox early this morning did you know that ice is melting so much archaeologists are discovering ancient ruins guess what those ruins were once not covered with ice the earth was in a warmer state at one time ever heard of procession of the equinox a wobble of the earth orbit that takes years to complete one cycle the sahara used to be green with rivers traversing it some do still flow underground antarctica used to be jungle as this procession proceeds environments change i not totally discounting your claims there is a lot of manmade pollution but i think some of this science is biased to favor the politically correct views of the day i do think we taking in a large enough picture to comprehend the true magnitude of climate change and it bordering on folly to claim to know exactly how to fix things often manmade solutions to problems compound the magnitude of problems further on or have unanticipated secondary repercussions ecology is a hot topic green sells there a whole industry being developed to compete against the oil barons but do let the marketing hype overwhelm you if you exjw you spent part of your life credulous to one fractured system of belief be mindful but do let green become your new god we still be here in years probably warmer but not mad max ing it unless destroys society lol
even with climate change forest neglect is still the biggest factor controlled fires prevent this sorta thing
i now learned things you never understand the reasons for war the causes and effects of climate change the way hollywood works the path to enlightenment the abomination of mankind on this planet it all led me to eternal truth that truth you ask it all about winning sheen
are you mentally retarded or just a troll there is literally a world wide student protest to do something about climate change
i just curious why you think we should become a galaxy spanning species that would be nice but that impossible without ftl we wo stay a single cohesive species over those distances if we want to make sure anything is spanning the galaxy it will be self aware life not specifically modern homo sapiens we are nowhere near reaching the maximum population the earth can support and trends suggests the population will stabilize anywhere from to billion people which is well under the earth carrying capacity which itself is ever increasing as our food and energy production technologies get better we expected to stabilize at billion because we hitting earth carrying capacity in fact we already the planet long term carrying capacity yes our farming continues to get better but we using almost all of the planet arable land to the detriment of the biosphere and climate change is cutting that available land remember we have to share the planet with the things that keep us alive and life on earth did evolve to be dedicated to supporting humans we have to leach off extra capacity what we doing now is collecting ecological debt what are your reasons for believing the colonization of the galaxy would be a good thing why do you agree with x before knowing if the respondent agrees with x is really a question
boy there are some less than decent answers here because it impossible for a person to comment on this without bias or opinion i give my opinions explicitly at the end and try to keep the explanation as objective as possible okay let walk through this instead of jumping head first at conclusions what is blm black lives matter is not an organization there is no club there is no meeting places there are no real members besides loose identification it not even really a movement it is an attempt to call attention to a problem it started after george zimmerman was exonerated for the death of trayvon martin it one of those things where the court ruled him not guilty but public opinion is strongly divided so on twitter some users posted blacklivesmatter implying that at the time mainstream america does not believe that the lives of black people matter this twitter tag further exploded with the death of michael brown an unarmed year old who was shot by a police officer after this blm began to be used to call attention to a new problem police brutality now let examine what is being argued for and against this criminal record one of the more famous deaths that invoked the blm hashtag is that of freddie gray freddie gray was beaten badly during his arrest and allegedly while he was being taken back to the police station he was left unbuckled and the driver swerved the car on purpose so that freddie would be thrown around the back this ended up with him bashing his head around while already in a critical state to the point where his bled out and died either before or soon after arriving at the police station now there were two arguments here one was that freddie gray is not a person deserving of any sympathy he was a career criminal and a threat to society he had been in and out of prison primarily on drug charges the other argument is that it is completely irrelevant whether or not he had a rap sheet the police were still out of line and the constitution affords certain rights and protections to those accused of a crime that idea of him being a criminal and deserving death is very very important here those against blm believe that they have picked very unsympathetic causes michael brown was a criminal freddie gray was a criminal alton sterling was a criminal there a strong image of young black men being criminals as it is and many believe blm is furthering this image by calling attention to and protecting those criminals reverse racism as i stated before the intended meaning of the hashtag blm is that it seems as though the media does call attention to the deaths of black youth thus devaluing their lives black lives matter and should thus their losses should not be dismissed as with any collection of words its meaning can be interpreted in any number of ways regardless of original intention one interpretation is that blm makes the assertion that only black lives matter and that others do not many simply do not believe the issue exists this is one of the most important parts and so by stating that black lives matter when in the eyes of the opposition they already do they reinforcing that above other races this interpretation is that blm is racist itself this is where all lives matter comes from as with any trend there is a spectrum there are those who are so far into it that they are actually racist against white people and they have brought a disproportionate amount of attention upon themselves this makes blm even less sympathetic the counter argument to the interpretation is that there is an implied too at the end black lives matter too this is to reinforce the original intention that black lives do matter more than any other race but that they matter just as much as every other race disruptiveness as with any civil rights movement you ca quietly sit at the sidelines and occasionally mention hey um we have a problem and expect change part of fighting for civil rights is to cause a disruption that forces people to pay attention to your cause a lot of people do take kindly to how disruptive blm protests have been and some do like fighting for civil rights at all this is nothing new in history from women suffrage to abolitionism to gay rights there are always people who strongly oppose any change or disruption at all you often hear i get where they coming from but do they have to do it like this defensiveness cognitive dissonance let be real people do like to be wrong people really do like to be told that they acting wrong and people really really do like to be told they discriminating being labelled a racist or homophobe is not a good thing some people may actually be completely egalitarian but feel targeted by blm others may be pretty prejudiced and are opposed to facing that they would prefer to ignore it when people feel attacked they get defensive and either become unsympathetic or outright go on the offense against that which they feel attacks them black on black violence anti police violence some people feel that the black community is overstating the effect of police brutality and believe it to be insignificant compared to other issues there also been an increase in violence or increase in coverage of violence perpetrated against police which further decreases sympathy for the twitter hashtag outright racism yep it still there there are people who straight up dislike black people they believe they are lesser or deserve their fate etc etc people said trayvon martin was a thug for wearing a hoodie and he was very sketchy looking i personally encountered no more than a handful of these people in my whole life but they certainly not an insignificant portion of the population so all of these reasons in combination make blm so unsympathetic to some people that they ignore or oppose the hashtag the problem is calls attention to and the people who push it here where i put in my personal opinion criminal record i despise the view of crime and punishment in this country people believe that those who commit a crime are forever criminals and that it is a core aspect of their persona and thus they should be punished and removed from society i find it abhorrent that people who are so patriotic have little regard for the bill of rights which is intended to protect the accused right to a trial right to a lawyer right to due process so on and so forth it does matter freddie gray was a criminal he was accused of something and should therefore be put through the justice system which will decide what to do and even that part is imperfect it is not up to police officers who often have little understanding of the law which is why the law gives them a lot of protection so they ca be sued for trying to do the good thing while not understanding legal nuance i think attacking victims for being criminals defies what the constitution stands for reverse racism this is childish societal envy it like nietzche master and slave concept when the slave tries to fight for their own equality to not be oppressed the master sees it as an attack on them everything was already the way it should be it was already fair giving the slave more rights means taking rights away from the master such as the right to have a slave people also believe that pointing out one problem excludes the existence of others yes there are societal conditions that make it harder for others than you no that does not mean that your problems do exist this is akin to saying climate change is real we had a lot of snow this winter i do dislike the aggression towards white people there is even animosity towards white people who are trying to help and that is just stupid you do convince someone to see your side by locking them out though i do understand why some people might be weary disruptiveness on one hand i think people have a fundamental misunderstanding of how change occurs being disruptive is absolutely necessary and should be encouraged to enact change meaningful social change can never happen with peaceful sidewalk picketing on the other hand i can see where opposers come from some of the demonstrations have been downright dangerous and asinine like lying down on a highway blocking people from getting to the airport cognitive dissonance again childishness people do like to face reality not much to say here without me just going off on a useless tirade that does make an argument black on black anti police it is absolutely messed up that some people are attacking police in the name of blm that is diametrically opposed to the goal we expect police to treat people better so that we can have a more trusting relationship how can we have a trusting relationship if we doing to them what they do to us i think people misunderstand black on black violence entirely for one it occurs at the same rate as white on white violence two there are many people and programs speaking out against it people also forget that it possible to tackle multiple problems at once you see this all the time why spend money on this when we still have homeless people why do you care about drug abuse when more people die from heart attacks well because women ca pop a baby out in one month it does work that way we also already know the easiest way to curb violence legalize drugs it simple effective and efficient racism pretty much indefensible position racists are weak minded people and racism ruins everything
compating climate change requires government action that could inconvenience corporations us conservatives hate that
i think climate change is caused by humans but if of the studies agree then there may be really bad methodology really heavy censorship
assuming your premise which is wrong since i support gay marriage abortion rights at the state level and legalized weed and prostitution who said we do believe in man made climate change not me i just do believe in the infallibility of the claim of catastrophic man made climate change the whole the science is settled bullshit is the antithesis of real science guys like newton kepler einstein and feynman would have laughed at your science climate science is far too new to make such a claim physics and chemistry have been around for centuries and they have testable theories and testable materials structures gases atoms molecules heat etc you ca test climate theories because they are inherently untestable you would need a bunch of test earths to experiment on
out of all the things we could do to start reversing climate change you latched onto the one thing that would allow you to judge other people while doing nothing yourself i impressed
climate change it just the most important to me if we do have a healthy planet we have nothing
if the ecosystem catastrophically fails due to climate change it might be single celled organisms and fungus for a very long time
climate change is the symptom capitalism is the problem human nature is the problem capitalism is the symptom and climate change is the result
preventing climate change is basically impossible under capitalism at this point the oil and gas companies have bought out everything now
i think the rise in ultra conservative candidacy will be seen by history as the greatest scam ever perpetrated against a democratic public step polarize the voters by methodically controlling and ratcheting up intensely vitriolic rhetoric so that a massive involved voter base supports you without question by saying that conservative christian values are under attack by playing upon people fear of change and by saying you the only people who will protect you you gain a backing that will not only fervently support you but will not question your actions because they too afraid to go anywhere else step gain the necessary financial and lobbying support of big business and sit so deeply in their pockets you can taste their ass hairs this is the true powerhouse that provides these otherwise illegitimate candidates the money to succeed all the corporate interests will get in return is everything they ask for result immense and unearned political power that is gained without doing anything hard like standing for principles gaining the love of the people or improving the condition of your citizens this is the reality of today political climate and i convinced all opposition including the more moderate traditional republican party is completely flummoxed as to how to counter this
anthropomorphic global warming basically man made climate change the debate around climate change is nt really about changing climates its about how pollution effects the climate and to what extent there s pretty solid evidence that fossil fuels increase the amount of in the atmosphere and we already know that is a greenhouse gas that can affect the environment that s enough for most people but the problem is nobody really knows how much the added affects the climate and some debate that its so minute that it makes no difference and that blaming weather phenomenon on cc is no different then blaming it on zeus computer models made by climatologists often try and show how climate is affected by greenhouse gases but not everyone has faith in these models math is hard to understand and this shit is a lot of math and even with these computer models if you apply a margin of error then the world has had static temperature for centuries but most can agree that reducing fossil fuel usage is better for the local and global environment and that being less dependent on a single energy source is a good thing so having renewables and nuclear are good first steps into sustainability until fusion replaces all energy needs i know there are other pollutants then

climate change
mostly these solutions require a civilization to build them and ours is more precarious than we like to admit i agree with this but i at least as worried about say ai getting out of our control and ending civilization so i want us to see climate change alongside these other grave threats
not some pain complete economic ruin canada is actually one of the countries least harmed by climate change potentially even benefitting from it so your case needs to be a lot stronger
i would think water is the biggest issue they may have lower taxes but you ca drink money to stay alive fortunately for us new england will be the most resilient part of the country when it comes to climate change
just to be clear the resolution was what was causing issues with saving as an or i still experience the inability to change cultures and get the biome banding no matter what resolution i use the cultures issue is right from the start the banding seems to happen after a few times trying to tweak some things in tools and seems to be related to the latitude based climate zones the more i tweak the more banded they get i can even see the bands change as i move the mapped region north south the band stays in the same latitude but by moving the continents north or south the area of the continent that experiences the issue changes
who would be a boy growing up in today climate feminists killed kurt cobain men my age are all the same they hate themselves amp feel ashamed for what they are amp can not change little heads filled up with lies raised only to apologize for thousand year conspiracies in gender studies histories put down at home drugged up at school helped to sit still amp follow rules help follow what their teachers say look see how well the girls behave men chastised demonized healthy males pathologized a man is just a dirty ape longing lust desire all rape your body is a loaded gun and all that it has done is wrong girls demands are sacrosanct boys complaints beneath contempt a good man knows his sex is bad the life of ease that he has had a good man turns his back on men puts women first in everything
back from work wow this uhh blew up i wanted to thank everyone on the ssc subreddit for their charity in responding and for trusting i was acting earnestly in particular thank you for taking the time to write back my day ran late and i have an early morning coming up so i have to add more to this topic tomorrow my plans are to respond to one or two notable comments i saw in this post respond to a few of the top level comments in the new climate change thread and start a new topic on the current status of negative carbon emissions it looks like there a lot of expertise in this community spread throughout different fields looking forward to these discussions edit oh nevermind i do and now will wait until tomorrow
oh well yeah if you compare african countries in general to the us currently then of course they do come close as it stands and overpopulation climate change are going to be and already are huge threats to a lot of sub saharan countries if had said that a black panther esque advanced society seemed improbable since africa got a lot of obstacles to overcome then sure yeah but to say that an advanced society will never emerge in africa and in the dickish superior way that he did not only is that baseless speculation which he provides no evidence for he just kinda assumes it obvious but it hypocritical as fuck i all for calling out liberal hyperbole and revisionist history but when someone makes fun of liberals by using their own crappy charged hyperbole which completely ignores all the positive trends like increasing democratization see gambia recent election crisis infrastructure investment to the tune of trillion and overall growth fuck that
we argue over which way is best for the government to screw us and help their buddies rather than the real issue climate change gun control border crisis are all emotional phrases that distract us from the real issue the government is no longer about the citizens
what the connection between heart problems and climate change this is an excellent question let review the literal only thing that changed in the last year and a half untested experimental shots but it the weather for sure same as smoking weed because nobody has done that for decades ca be the shots killing people nope not at all
nyc la will be in chaos whereas the midwest will barely notice a change i am not so sure in fact i am pretty sure that most people will be fucked because of climate change will regularly kill your crops causing famines even among those that are self sufficient and there really are not many like that we all depend on industrial machinery
how is climate change an adults only issue
brainwashed huh let me guess you probably thought obama was a us citizen climate change is a hoax antifa is the biggest threat to democracy biden is a pedo and the best of all with americans dead i bet money you think covid is fake and people wearing masks are sheep
animal ag accounts for of total us emissions same as plant ag the source you linked to says back in before scientists realized they were measuring farming emissions right which led to underestimating livestock emissions and despite the fact that us farmers are were legally exempt from reporting their article why isnt the u s counting meat producers climate like other industries are required to the total bovine methane production has also decreased over time fewer bison among other factors so it clearly not one of the main factors behind climate change source according to this article and graph methane has risen dramatically thanks to livestock and fossil fuel articles as for your final link you do realize that world wide we feed livestock of the soy we grow while humans only eat around resources soybeans and in the united states livestock production is responsible for percent of erosion percent of all applied pesticides and percent of antibiotics consumed while the animals themselves directly consume percent of our oat production and percent of our corn travel is the livestock industry destroying the i can assure you eating a vegan diet is likely to save animals crop production is viable without crop protection which means killing pests animals will die for your food there is no diet that will save animals clearly you have actually looked at the data on this subject huh we now have around billion humans yet livestock outnumber us by tens of chart of the day this is how many animals we eat each we feed them most of the food we grow plus of the fish we catch becomes livestock article us fish food despite the fact that we already overfished of our planet fish stocks are used up fisheries subsidies must and that dumped fishing gear is one of the largest sources of plastic in our news wwf ghost gear is the deadliest form of marine plastic it currently makes up of the great pacific garbage patch in a multitude of ways livestock are devastating biodiversity of it so biodiversity meat and speeding up mass extinction presumably if the center for biological diversity is telling us to go vegan to help prevent mass how meat harms wildlife then i going to take their word over a physiotherapist who does seem to do any deep levels of research and does fully read evidence offered to them especially after seeing some of these issues first hand back when i used to raise livestock as sustainably as i could and after all the research that made me realize why livestock farming was backfiring so badly in my path towards sustainably since switching to vegan only practices our area biodiversity has increased each year and our rain barrels do immediately run out the moment drought hits our animals drank much more during heat waves so i often ran out of rain water for the plants just keeping the animals alive so far i have use any lethal methods in my veggie garden the most violence i participate in is clipping infested leaves off my fruit trees and disposing of the branches with our community composting system
working under the assumption that humans are driving climate change you are correct all life would probably not die out but quite a lot to maybe most of the life we know of would but eventually humans would die off or society would collapse to the point where the planet could start recovering
i mean for being a kid she has done alot to at least get people to talk about climate change i do appreciate that she is nt acting like she knows everything and any time she deffends climate change she does so by asking people to actually read what the scientists are putting out but she is still just a kid its not like she is a hero or gon na single handedly save the world just a cool kid that s way focused on one issuecand got a movement going with people her age however she should probably stick to people her age and let the adults deal with the actual policy aspect of climate change
if the marketplace of ideas is such an effective way of sorting good ideas fro bad why do so many shit ones survive we have more information at our fingertips than any time in history but we getting dumber we still teaching creationism in school climate change is controversial there is a large and growin contingent of anti vaxxers how many people would been convinced that hillary clinton runs peado factory under a pizza place before the internet or that major events are being faked by crisis actors
this time first week of june last year texas was underwater due to flooding right now texas especially houston dat below sea level elevation tho is underwater if sea levels continue to rise as the ice caps melt and severe weather patterns grow increasingly destructive unseasonal unpredictable then coastal cities are going to be setting post katrina new orleans as their ceiling within the next decade or two not in not in hillary does not give a shit she thinks iranians and republicans are a much grander threat see the first democratic debate bernie said climate change was the most pressing issue and with that simple truthful non ridiculous statement he locked my vote the fuck down credit to as well he spent more time on the stump and on the stage talking about global warming than anyone who ran during his abbreviated appearance i can not vote for a politician who makes a literal platform out of kicking the can down the road i wipe an old person ass but i be fucked if i volunteer to clean up after their shit
supergenius ultimate social engineer supernatural mechanical knowledge social perceptiveness business good looks indomitable study of knowledge unquestioned finally going to get something done about climate change jesus christ it took a cyoa to get it done
unfortunately state policies for climate change are extremely ineffective without influencing the polluting states fortunately since your economy is so large you do influence the rest of the country in a major way as you create pay for a demand for more efficient renewable energy that the rest of the country benefits from and can use
if the president can declare an emergency for this and seize people land that honestly the greatest precedent he could possibly give socialists the country has a national emergency called climate change we need to nationalize all of the fossil fuel companies to shut them down we have a national emergency in healthcare we need to nationalize all of these private for profit hospitals that charge dollars for a kleenex oh and we going to seize all assets above a million dollars to pay for it it now illegal to be a billionaire national emergency
i do necessarily see anything but the tip of argentina surviving climate change either unfortunately
both national and act recognise climate change is happening and that some level of action should be taken is the difference between science and anti science really the marginal differences in policy to address a problem which all sides agree is occurring specific actions is a policy decision not a scientific one
what do you mean he been denying climate change for years
and do give me the per capita speech the earth does give a shit about per capita what is this even supposed to mean you literally sound like climate change deniers who say stuff like mother earth will sort herself out what a vacuous statement
some truth mixed in with lies yes it heat is dictated by the sun but what do you think greenhouse gasses are they trap in the heat and make it harder for the heat to radiate out cutting down trees makes it harder for the earth to filter out the greenhouse gasses and substances an example of climate change that was reversed mostly would be the ozone layer hole there was a gas that was popular to use in hairspray and other things it would go into the atmosphere and bind with the ozone making it ineffective we banned that substance and the hole started to get smaller one anecdotal story about a cold place does not disprove climate change
why do a lot of dumb people deny climate change
actually science banned climate change denial from being posted
or maybe just maybe they are just cashing in on the fear of climate change
ok so you are just making shit up as you go your obviously biased anecdotal evidence has nothing to do with statistics stem careers are decidedly more liberal period climate change renewable energy pesticide research in regards to be colony collapse these are all liberal schools of thought and those are just a few randoms you are literally saying because it says liberal arts must be more liberal so the opposite of that stem is obviously more conservative conservatives as a whole have become science deniers see climate change denial see epa rollbacks see the decrease of national parks space they literally are presented with statistically relevant facts and choose to ignore what they mean but sure keep blaming it on those youngins with liberal art degrees that are behind all of the fake news science you keep denying
so you people now support the ipcc do you someone here a while ago claimed the ipcc were wrong when they referred to the hiatus in warming and that warming is actually going super fast so when the ipcc discusses the slowdown in warming which places into question the very notion that human emissions are driving warming this sub disagrees with them when one paper makes it their scientific work to try and prove science is done by vote rather than academic challenge the fact they point out the good scientists agree with the ipcc is now supposed to support the position of the climate alarmists here at climatehysterics i gon na need some consistency here is the ipcc the go to group for the latest in climate change information or are they only used when their information fits the humans are shit narrative
regarding galileo again you can not compare the scientific community now to what it was back then when the church was largely in charge of everything and for every scientist who went against the mainstream with an idea that everyone thought was crazy but he turned out to be right there are a hundred who turned out to be wrong the point is unless there a good reason to object and enough experts in agreement it just baffles me that anyone thinks we should throw all our eggs in the basket of a few people going against the mainstream regarding your link how does that show actual scientists were involved from wikipedia on them quiggin argued that the members of the panel selected by lomborg were generally towards the right and to the extent that they had stated views to be opponents of kyoto sachs also noted that the panel members had not previously been much involved in issues of development economics and were unlikely to reach useful conclusions in the time available to commenting on the copenhagen consensus climatologist and ipcc author stephen schneider criticised lomborg for only inviting economists to in order to achieve a true consensus i think lomborg would had to invite ecologists social scientists concerned with justice and how climate change impacts and policies are often inequitably distributed philosophers who could challenge the economic paradigm of one dollar one vote implicit in cost benefit analyses promoted by economists and climate scientists who could easily show that lomborg claim that climate change will have only minimal effects is not sound science lomborg countered criticism of the panel membership by stating that sachs disparaged the consensus dream team because it only consisted of economists but that was the very point of the project economists have expertise in economic prioritization it is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease so again who are the scientists
can will express valid points are dickheads sadly those criteria are entirely subjective how a person fits into the social dynamic of a particular team is going to depend entirely on the team and what type of person they are looking for i work in a city gov and i noticed quite a few different departments have stereotypical types of people they hire and those personality types would fit into a different department here a few examples sanitized because i do wanna get name shame dept a is usually to yr old men gruff and old school typically includes borderline offensive joking blue collar cowboy types given a equally skilled range of candidates they gon na pick someone like them over some fashion forward gay college intern dept b is your typical lawyer type environment suits are worn every day jokes are hr safe and polite but relationships are often padded or built on who drinking with who and whether or not you showed up to their rich house for holiday party or summer boating on the lake given a range of equally skilled candidates these types of people are gon na hire someone like them blue collar dept a above would likely describe them as dickheads or douchebags dept c is your typical green environmental recycling group they touchy feely and have pictures of kittens on their desks etc etc they are middle class have pot luck fundraisers and cubicles are adorned with random crap given a range of equally qualified candidates they gon na pick someone who believes the same things they do and not someone who brings fresh ideas or challenges their preconceived assumptions about climate change or waste prevention expressing valid points or not being a dickhead is not enough to get you hired in most cases you got to apply to the right job customize your resume to speak to the position being hired then show you fit into that specific team assuming you want to work for that specific team you may find you do and re strategy your approach to fitting into a different team
and climate change and the health problems that come from pollution toxins in our sink and shower water man made carcinogens everywhere wildfire smoke florida floods with alligators swimming around in there pandemics et cetera man does life suck but it does have to be like this if those with the power to do so would just change the entire system every system
the livelihoods aspect is probably why climate change is a fight we can not currently win people needs jobs to survive and the third world wants jobs to bring them out of poverty unless a clean energy source is found within years our own instinct to survive is going to lock in our own extinction event by triggering a positive feedback loop
one of the absolute worst parts of any conversation about this stuff is the tendency to attribute absolutely every bad thing to climate change and the exclusion of all other data i trust you read cadillac desert fantastic book all about this stuff in california the refusal to build meaningful surface storage is just insane sort this list by year completed and even though the population of california has increased by since the amount of surface storage has increased by less than since then now there lots of other things going on but this refusal is at least as fact averse as the worst of the climate change skeptic crowd
also ecological footprint relative to economy size is a very good indicator of how green a country is the us is by that measure whereas many poor african countries contribute almost nothing to climate change and are ranked lower the climate does not care about economy size only the total amount of climate changing gases
climate change is real but not nearly the apocalyptic threat the globalists want us to think it is sorry not sorry
and that we could stop climate change if we just always kept out of daylight savings because then the sun is up as long each day
climate change will not be what ends human civilization not progressing past a fossil fuel stage will be i have no concern whatsoever that heavy industry wo be able to find an alternative as soon as their profits are actually hurt they start to take action the solution might be just as negative for the environment but they certainly wo give up once the oil runs out even liberal minded people are really sold on the whole renewable power idea who are you talking about i never seen liberals talk up a need for coal and oil if anything they overly friendly with renewables seeing them as some sort of panacea and wondering why we have switched everything to solar and wind already fwiw i a big proponent of next generation nuclear as a stepping stone and potentially a means to power commercial shipping which currently relies on the dirtiest fuel oil available and for which no renewable alternatives yet exist sadly many liberals are still afraid of the word itself imagining chernobyl and fukushima as inevitable rather than freak accidents of bad year old designs
i still do get how dismissing something essential that is offered for free and to my own benefit is beneficial to a cause like stopping climate change not sure why you are making fun of a spelling or grammar mistake of mine instead of helping me understand your point
how can you just say that the electoral college should be abolished sure the idea of pure majority view and the popular vote deciding everything sounds like a dream but the system was structured like that by our founding fathers specifically to stop things like tyranny of the majority from occurring our system is much more complex by looking at individual states and districts and seeing how much depth there really is however one could argue that this has drastically changed due to the new makeup and clustering of people who share similar ideologies coasts liberals mid west conservatives but as has been argued you have to deal with having uniformed people voting also as i said in a different thread earlier an increase in voting wo make much of a difference there been studies about non voters and typically they no different than voters besides the fact that they usually more uniformed and politically ignorant than voters by increasing the number of people who vote it may sound good like you getting more of an opinion but they really just cluster into the groups we have now in the grand scheme of things having everyone vote wo lead to a drastic political climate change it might tip some congressional elections but rarely will it ever have a big impact like many people think it might
tell me what going on in our skies aerosol spraying geoengineering and then we can talk about climate change i tired of the gag order
dude climate change is the current thing
climate change is a science meteorology and geology are sciences and meteorological biological and oceanographical evidence all point to a rapid on going climate change and an extremely high likelyhood of it being man made but you seem to have decided already based on your gut feeling and that naturally trumps the years of education decades of work experience and tens of thousands of hours of research every damn scientist has put into it
i think you misrepresenting what libertarians especially left leaning ones like me believe we do believe volunteerism is going to solve the world problems we believe that people will have an interest in solving problems that affect them climate change has really only been scientifically confirmed for a couple of decades it takes time for opinions to change mostly because an individual opinions do change much but you can already see a huge shift in attitude toward climate change within the population at large the green movement is big and environmental concerns have become a part of all political platforms some parties are more concerned about it and have more radical solutions but everyone at least thinking about it companies are starting to be rewarded for being more green they voluntarily switching to more ecologically friendly materials and processes because this actually gives them an advantage in the market the right will be slow to accept the new information but they always are that why they are conservative conservatives are always the slow ones to accept change but they can also keep us from changing too radically by the way i think the left is guilty of some pretty dumb things too to me the rejection of gmo crops is a bit of science denial as well
op is a fool climate change is real but not because of those weather events the existence of wildfires floods tornadoes hurricanes and cloudy days for that matter are evidence of climate change we looking at long term here please do your research
yes because when a kid is feeling down nowadays it mostly because he she is contemplating the nuances of inflation and climate change not because they got fat shamed on their tiktok channel or anything like that depression is way too complicated to sum up with three examples that coincidently align with a certain way of thinking it echo chamber clickbait nothing more
does drumpf totally mean it when he says climate change is a chinese hoax or is he just playing to the brain dead republican base
too bad some people think this instead of thinking he a person who wants to do everything he can to dismiss science denial i can give many more qualified people but you likely would accept their word on vaccinations climate change or mask effectiveness either probably because you are a skeptic and in the wrong sub
in the same post you say we have an exponentially growing population that exceeds our planet carrying capacity for life but also we need to stop killing each other seems like we need something to thin the herd eventually all this technology will lead to another world war plague or dramatic climate change and the problem will fix itself
and a desire to actually do something about climate change
they also keep fucking with the data look at a list of warmest years from reports from years ago example to compare to this oa climate anomalies and the warmest years rankings change how does settled science keep changing
pretty simple things like child care benefit for kids if both parents are making a year pretty much cancel out their taxes a year in alberta for instance means in taxes with no additional deductions so this household is paying in income tax the child care benefit for kids by itself is so your net tax is on household income you can further reduce your net income to increase your ccb and decrease your income taxes such as climate change credit rrsp working tax credits child care deductions etc i can see how you can easily get to negative income tax from there
good on gov murphy this is a regressive tax scheme and there not a single climate change argument that can be made to change that fact it regressive why not charge the million apartments a fair property tax that could fund transit and education in the city it a regressive tax scheme double tax scheme in some cases
fun thing about isis is they can be anywhere fort riley bombing attempt boston bombing wichita airport bombing attempt so yeah isis is a large threat to our national security in the army we say focus on the meter target climate change global warming is more of a meter target edit thanks for the downvotes
love the car congrats also a muscle car is not a political statement stuff needs to be done about climate change but we can still enjoy cool cars if people want to buy electric let em does mean we have to
those scientist you hold so highly were caught conspiring to push a political agenda oh i know a review of their activities by their peers found nothing wrong yeah like cops never see anything wrong with what cops do etc etc etc if you ever took the time to do research outside of what the msm feeds you you will discover that all global warming climate change info filters through an organization called the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change if you then took the time to dig deeper you would find this is an oganization which operates under the auspices of the it has direct ties to the infamous rio summit held by the which gave birth to agenda ever heard of agenda we need to get some broad based support to capture the public imagination so we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest prof stephen schneider stanford professor of climatology lead author of many ipcc reports effective execution of agenda will require a profound reorientation of all human society unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources this shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision making at every level un agenda we got to ride this global warming issue even if the theory of global warming is wrong we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy timothy wirth president of the un foundation is the only hope for the planet that the industrialized civilizations collapse is it our responsiblity to bring that about maurice strong founder of the un environment programme current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class involving high meat intake use of fossil fuels appliances air conditioning and suburban housing are not sustainable maurice strong rio earth summit a massive campaign must be launched to de develop the united states de development means bringing our economic system into line with the realities of ecology and the world resource situation paul ehrlich professor of population studies if we do overthrow capitalism we do have a chance of saving the world ecologically i think it is possible to have an ecologically sound society under socialism i do think it is possible under capitalism judi bari principal organiser of earth first nations are in effect ceding portions of their sovereignty to the international community and beginning to create a new system of international environmental governance as a means of solving otherwise unmanageable crises lester brown worldwatch institute in my view after fifty years of service in the united nations system i perceive the utmost urgency and absolute necessity for proper earth government there is no shadow of a doubt that the present political and economic systems are no longer appropriate and will lead to the end of life evolution on this planet we must therefore absolutely and urgently look for new ways dr robert muller un assistant secretary general the concept of national sovereignty has been immutable indeed a sacred principle of international relations it is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation un commission on global governance report no matter if the science of global warming is all phony climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world christine stewart former canadian minister of the environment we are close to a time when all of humankind will envision a global agenda that encompasses a kind of global marshall plan to address the causes of poverty and suffering and environmental destruction all over the earth al gore earth in the balance it does matter what is true it only matters what people believe is true paul watson co founder of greenpeace the models are convenient fictions that provide something very useful dr david frame climate modeler oxford university the data does matter we not basing our recommendations on the data we basing them on the climate models prof chris folland hadley centre for climate prediction and research
i disagree we can afford for everyone to have a basic standard of living that includes optional ie non food shelter and air goods if we simply work toward cleaner sources of energy neither the us nor the rest of the world is ever going to voluntarily cut back on their lifestyle in a big enough way to stop anthropogenic climate change rather we have to find technologies and other ways to ensure the same lifestyle and the future ways of living for everyone that does impact the planet that way in any case even if the us cut its emissions by percent we still have global warming china is the problem you can bet a billion people who are still generally superstitious enough to believe a ground up rhino horn will make them sexually potent are going to give up fast cars and heat in the winter because some white guys say they should
and the guy lived before climate change was really going
it is and it ridiculous in the face of industrial impact on climate change it a loss in every aspect
well here a statement made by the american physical society i say that constitutes support from physicists they basically say that there is strong evidence but we need to invest more into research to accurately model outcome predictions they also specifically acknowledge the rising concentration of greenhouse gases which you claim have nothing to do with global warming and seem to be trying to gain false credibility by saying you in agreement with the physics community when they seem to disagree i would love to hear your response to this as this is the first time anyone has claimed to me that physicists universally disagree with climate change that is certainly a new one similarly here is the statement made by the american chemical society there seems to be an agreement among chemists even within the world leader in the science of ignoring climate change that greenhouse gas emissions by humans is the leading cause of global warming and reducing those emissions is paramount is the main greenhouse gas when ghg are being referenced in case you are aware being present in the atmosphere and acting as a greenhouse gas is speculation it measurable reality i do know who told you otherwise but they were poorly informed at best there are two pretty great responses to a question of why is resting at the bottom of the atmosphere even though it heavier than air in today world there a metric shit ton of misinformation out there so if you latch onto the first bit of info that supports your idea without researching it or verifying with credible sources you are very likely to be wrong and dangerously so in this case
nan
i would say it a stupid thought so much as it is logic less enjoy life now instead of worrying about something so far in the distant future climate change should be a bigger concern to you than the end of the universe that kind of thinking is just escapism from being productive now
a universal basic income spends less of its total funding as overhead less than when you just need to send out the checks also recipients are universal so it an equal entitlement and the check can be spent on anything this is very different from the state current welfare program which demands applicants perform many tasks like filling out paperwork interviewing with bureaucrats and releasing private information like whether you have drugs in your system or which jobs you applying to after that there are only certain things you can do with that welfare like buy specific types of food or rent specific types of housing a ubi maximizes freedom and fairness compared to welfare programs which minimizes them moving to a ubi is much more libertarian than the current welfare state it reduces the power of government and instead empowers all citizens with the freedom to choose how best to use the protective service of the state citizens do have true freedom until they are guaranteed a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that only possible by cutting them a check for their basic needs this is called positive wiki andrew also wants to sunset old laws and also wants to literally de centralize the state by relocating federal agencies outside of washington dc he end the drug war legalize marijuana and free non violent drug users from prison and expunge their records also instead of spending an enormous amount on government environmental programs his plan is to invest trillion in cheap loans to homeowners to upgrade to residential clean energy themselves this way american citizens will have the most freedom to use their own tax dollars to combat climate change and benefit directly from upgrades to their property that much preferable to the alternatives right now i did even get into how yang plans to massively cut military spending overseas and bring that money back home left libertarians can see it quite clearly andrew yang is one of us and we all terribly excited he the first left libertarian to run for president that i ever seen
i a little curious why does climate change really matter with nasa
i come to trust climate change science after more than two years of listening to covid science science does need your trust it just a way of measuring objective facts lots of people refuse to live in reality
we should be forced into paying more in taxes to support reducing our impact on climate change but rather encouraged at an early age that it the right thing to do we should be able to volunteer our money to that cause or choose to support it through a sales tax and if the business we shop at wants to impose a sales tax to support that cause then they should be able to just as how we can choose to shop elsewhere to avoid that tax what you are saying is monumentally stupid and goes against human nature do you honestly think these things would work
i hate this shit why not be smug if you doing your bit to stop climate change
yes valeting my car at a restaurant is the same thing as taking a private jet ride on a whim ffs we can live without guest performers if the trade off is degradation of the environment none of this is even remotely necessary i ca believe you sympathizing with these ppl as if it so hard and tragic if they ca get to some concert on time when ppl are fleeing countries on foot to escape climate change here a crazy idea space out your concerts and events like of the world population does so you can get to them by other means of transporation what the fuck is with ppl defending this behavior as if you will ever be in a position to benefit from this status quo giving intense temporarily embarrassed millionaires energy
so let me know if i m understanding you correctly you believe that because i m not in absolute agreement with you i must be a partisan republican and because some parts of climate legislation was made by republicans i thus must agree with it i just do nt understand the correlation you re trying to make why are you telling me about republicans and their policy ideas i think both major political parties are ill equipped to deal with this problem i think boiling this down to a mere partisan issue is so reductionist it just unhelpful i can only be further skeptical of your motivations if you re trying to make this a partisan issue one major component of the problem is out lavishly wasteful lifestyles coal is only burned because we want more power for heat cooling gadgets etc industry only creates and ship products that people go out and purchase in the last few decades society consumerism has become disgustingly toxic i hear it all too much its the big corporations fault but those big corporations are a direct byproduct of ourselves and out habits no one wants to be the change they just want someone else to fix and be responsible their problems carbon taxes credits is just a tax on the poor and an attempt to force people to change their behaviors by stealing their resources poor people are the ones who will be most negatively impacted and the ones who often do nt have the means to change its those with means who buy a new iphone every year and throw their oold one into a landfill are the ones who most need to change and have the means to do so a tax likely is nt going to change those types of people there also the fact taxes to change behavior often does nt work or has other adverse effects i d rather not really get into this i dislike politics as it always ends with the other person telling me i just want children to suffer and die or something
we do have our problems like climate change inequality and fast rising housing prices nonetheless we can complain about them from the comfort of our sofas not from a miserable trench filled with remains of your comrades life is not good but used to be far worse at least in germany
think it more an anti climate change movement
i think people here and also people like trump need to stop using their personal life experiences to support or argue against climate change just because it started snowing after years or it stopped snowing and the winter does feel as strong in recent times does mean climate change is real or hoax in fact it does mean anything at all a change over years is statistically irrelevant to say anything about climate change also do forget while weather by definition always changes climate also does just on a much slower time scale the main urgency is that we humans are increasing the rate of climate change so something that might have happened over years now can possibly happen over years do take the numbers literally

trump epa head said climate change would be a problem for years people were like says who epa just admitted uh no one actually
it actually the other way around yang ubi system stands stronger on it own while most of what sanders is proposing are good proposals intended to tackle symptoms of the disease instead of making a more fundamental impact strong unions make no sense when their core task of negotiating good working conditions ca start from a strong negotiating position ubi gives them this strong negotiating position as they get the ability to walk away from the table if there no good offer coming medicare all is a legit good idea and yang is also in favor of that as indeed it a necessity student and medical debt however are problematic i highly agree that costs of higher education have reached a point where they need to be addressed but i do think debt forgiveness by itself is enough education in private hands is education which has a profit incentive instead of societal progress incentive this does mean that education has to be nationalized but it does mean that government as a stand in for society needs to regulate prices curriculum and entree requirements if you can run a private school under those circumstances and still run a profit good for you and there should be no impediment against doing so the green jobs programme is an interesting one mainly because bernie plan is a jobs plan with a bit of a green afterthought i personally really concerned about climate change so i would have preferred to have seen it the other way around this means employing the carbon tax carbon dividend approach to give an incentive to provide greener alternatives but also that nuclear should be a priori ruled out in my opinion a carbon tax will probably lead to more jobs because for example bike couriers become more attractive than car couriers but they also slower so you need more of them there be a shift from mining engineers towards nuclear engineers etc if you provide the right incentives which a carbon tax high enough would do the green jobs will automatically appear and if they not enough of them no disaster because ubi will allow people to work more part time without losing living standard if they want so you need more personnel anyway
hey you see value in a novelty of a young child getting media attention yes if it spreads the message and it does her message has mobilized tens of thousands of people to demonstrations i can explain what real change is but i explicitly said i was going to bother so you ca anyone with any small bit of knowledge with the problems of climate change understand what real change is yes so demonstrate you know it and explain it refer it in five sentences for example
who have thought you could be both an rfs volunteer and a climate denier yet here we are are you suggesting he is a climate denier in fact i surprised he been left of the list given he a rhodes scholar and bachelors in both economics and law and a masters in arts politics and speaks at climate denial conferences abbott told the group the ostracisation of those who did not accept climate science was the spirit of the inquisition the thought police down the ages he also reprised his assertion that the so called settled science of climate change was absolute australia tony abbott says climate change is probably doing good
ehhhh a lot of climate change theories are still just that theories the earth goes through constant cycles and just as much as climate change deniers are forcing an agenda those who push for climate change are also forcing a specific agenda with the pc console debate there can be absolutely no question about the truth pcmr for life
i not talking about being nonpolitical in the work place a lot of people do bring politics into the work place i am talking about being apolitical personally in world in which we are facing everything from climate change to police brutality to political corruption it a cop out
oh i did realize this there only ways you can come to hating biden for president you eat up everything trump says and disregard any facts from actual authorities you too rich and do feel any of the problems in america today climate change systemic racism healthcare education keep touting conspiracy theories it only get supported by deluded people unless you actually back up anything you say
oh absolutely and climate change will do much the same do nt forget wars over water that will occur
most people on either side of the aisle are ruled by their emotions very true i normally do put much effort into carefully explaining my thoughts in full detail and fairness cause most comments do get seen much there are absolutely fucking morons on the conservative side too there what billion people in the world at least billion are morons if you think any of my views are based in emotion and completely unsubstantiated by any facts feel free to articulate that argument and i respond i care more about holding the correct view on an issue than i do about being a part of any ideology i take it you not a christian then why did you think this was a poignant statement to make why would you intentionally make the incorrect implication that only religious nuts are conservative you are proving my point about shitty critical thinking and analytical skills you came apparently wanting to debate some point but hobbled yourself out of the gate with that garbage thought there were a ton of great points you could have made but went with the one that only scores points in liberal echo chambers yes compassion is absolutely a second rate value how about justice how about equality in many contexts compassion is opposed to both i personally debated liberals in threads about isis fighters not being allowed to return to the eu calling for compassion for them they argued that literally every criminal should be given the chance of rehabilitation even if the actual success rate of rehabilitation is piss poor that conversation did even delve into distinguishing between different types of criminals violent crime financial crime unintentional crimes like manslaughter which would have added an entirely different dimension to discuss whether society should rehabilitate all criminals that how shallow that garbage level of analysis was all criminals of all backgrounds and circumstances deserve a blanket chance at rehabilitation really a good middle school debate team can pick that shit apart in minutes liberals think conservatives are dumb and believe things like majority of conservatives are religious ideologues because liberal propaganda constructs an entirely different world based on complete bullshit then calls anyone who does accept that socially constructed view to be racist sexist revisionist science conspiracy theorists etc that bullshit world is constructed to convince conservatives or centrists it constructed to guilt the various factions within the left to stay united all while the core of the liberal platform marches ever further left you have classical liberals who have debated against and otherwise opposed conservatives their entire lives being deemed as co conspirators to the white supremacists the real idiots are not the people who refuse to take liberal ideology at face value the world is facing apocalyptic climate change within years predicted every years for the last years the idiots are the people who actually believe this shit and yes if someone has been crying wolf for years and you are even starting to question their judgement or motives even a little bit you a fucking moron russiagate kavanaugh hearings muellerdud no sane person would continue to trust the liberal media after all of these amounted to nothing more than fabricated story arcs to keep viewership up and to give the literally dying liberal leadership something to stay relevant on re russiagate all the so called proof has now been completely confirmed to be bogus the steele dossier was already found to be fiction paid for by hillary and mueller conveniently neglected to mention that the only way anyone can continue to believe that trump is some kind of cartoon villian that is committing the most heinous crimes in public view but getting away with all of it is if you someone who believes in the socially constructed and utterly deluded liberal world view that thinks cartoon villians exist in real life and that apocalyptic events can happen every years like some kind of cartoon story arc these are all things not substantiated by facts and when i say facts i mean factual records of things that happened or conversations that took place not some talking head giving its nth degree of separation opinion that one has to choose to belive in not unlike a religion
i choose to believe yes we can fix this but it is not going to be from the us it will be from other countries who believe that it is real and it needs to be fixed now i have been researching a lot of nanotech that can be used to help combat this think nanobots that can modify particles and rid of greenhouse gases and also genetically modifying trees and plants to take in much more then normal the thing is we ca fight it when major countries choose not to help there are only about major countries in the world that consistently fight climate change and that is a real shame if all of the world major countries helped then i am almost certain we could fix this by also in case you are not aware the switch to clean energy is gaining power exponentially due to the fact that it is now cheaper for factories and companies to use clean renewable energy then dirty fuels and as long as we continue to support companies like tesla and other pioneers that continuously put effort into progressing clean energy we should be fine
a step forward is still a step in the right direction i agree with there tonnes that needs to be done still climate change and pollution are two issues that are anything but insignificant it is still nice every now and then to look at these headlines and seek validation in our collective efforts as indians in saving our country and this planet as an aside to emphasize on your comment regarding how bad the pollution still is that fact does not alone tell us that we or our government are being lazy probably it just shows us how bad the situation already was all this time remember the asian brown cloud that was the freakiest man made pollution effect that i can think of presently
used to be better though with the climate change winters are getting hotter and no longer snows in urban areas also at pm on summer is a living hell
not sure why you getting downvoted it does which is why i understand what climate change global warming is
lol how many hundreds of billions of euros has germany invested in the energiewende it because you abandoned the best technology for producing zero emission power and gone with technologies that while vital in mitigating climate change can not power an industrial economy on their own with present technology

climate change seriously what the fuck america you the only god damned country which still denies this is a fucking problem
yes and nations will continue to do absolutely nothing about it maybe it time to blockade the fossil fuel industry with massive protests at their entrances it the only way to force governments to care about climate change and pollution
when buying from supermarkets i almost always go for stuff listed as light roast cause usually that closer to my medium than the medium beans depending on where you are i would bet you could find high quality coffee for closer to lbs which depending on how much you drink is too unreasonable switching to smaller cups goes a long way with this as others have noted but that not ideal of course coffee freezes quite well so buying in bulk is worth looking into some food for thought though coffee production is going to be severely impacted by climate change so this is probably the cheapest specialty coffee will be for a long ass time so i think you might as well get it while the getting is good
not caused by humans there is great consensus of climate change is caused by humans i wonder what your statement is based on
what wrong with having a scientific discussion one of the big talking points for leftists is to call us science deniers they have essentially castigated us for being scientifically ignorant in our discussion of anthropogenic global warming the more we inform ourselves the more we can ensure that overzealous leftist policies do not hinder economic growth in the name of climate alarmism denying climate change is a scientifically ignorant argument the earth climate has never been a steady one and we know that has to do with a number of factors involving abiotic conditions leading to climate cycles for the entire billion years of earth existence the real debate is whether or not anthropogenic contributions to greenhouse gasses are the major contributor to the currently changing climate and if that means catastrophic consequences will follow
i mean if lundgren or holland or whatever is a man of science with a voice that can reach people and is being vocal about climate change maybe he deserves to be ripped on climate change is a joke
you see climate change like everything else exists on a spectrum bill the end of the world is nye
what is your problem i said climate change is a major problem do you honestly believe climate change could cause human extinction
ahh yes the old moral superiority to an observation of reality why talk about the world that we live in when we can talk about some hypothetical world and american exceptionalism massive innovation is needed to fight climate change but my point was that unless you essentially force other nations to follow carbon emissions will not be addressed in a meaningful way
the best way to join the extinction rebellion is to make a effort in your day to day life to reduce consumption this is a lie told to shift responsibility on to individual action in reality we all know climate change is a collective problem that requires a collective response engaging in political action is far more important than reducing your personal carbon footprint although i encourage people to do both
that obviously a sarcastic response to the stupid alex jones tweet in related news rush limbaugh asserts that hurricane irma is fake news manufactured by the libruls to get us to believe in climate change edit that was sarcastic rush means it
people do debunk him all the time but the size of his platform along with the rate at which he post buries them for example his rebuttal bill nye gender spectrum bullcrap louder with crowder video was full of lies the title too gender spectrum did he mean sexuality spectrum then he proceeds to create a whole video around that one intentional misinterpretation to deny climate change and paint bill nye as a psych i agreed with steven when he said that those without a real real education in the environmental sciences should be speaking from a position of authority about climate change but everything else in that video was an outright lie
there is one silver lining a bad silver lining but hope that there may e survival of civilization the poorer countries the ones growing by use of fossil fuels will be the most effected by climate change they will be where most of the worse effects start so it is possible that climate change at least the rate of fossil fuel release will level off the middle east does nt have the resources to hold the population it does with climate change we currently are seeing a backlash against immigrants to europe what is most likely gon na happen is that as the situation gets worse the economy will be like a war economy except it will be about the environment total efficiency and recycling the united states agriculture will increase and we can expect to see more people commissioned as farmers i hope all in all humanity as a whole is nt too badly fucked yet but for a lot of us were goners
there must be a need first for something to be invented climate change poverty diseases we do not need to go to mars we need to fix those things i mentioned i can warn you right now that using need to justify us going to mars is not going to work cause we do exactly need to go there again stating something will take this or that long when the tech does exist is absurd you can say it will be difficult but we do know how long would it take saying that it wo take that long because of something that maybe is going to happen is way way more absurd in fact my position is the opposite of that it is boring and mundane there is nothing absurd about it it is just a drab generally arguments like that just do not work you do know either but what we do know is that terraforming is really really slow process it wo be decades if we make a breakthru we can maybe decrease that to round years the next breakthru will maybe halve that it is amazing that you even try to argue this but i can only assume that you have no clue how long terraforming takes in real life in movies it is seconds with a biobomb which in real life cause raging wildfires category hurricanes horribly horribly violent weather events as the entire climate changes air and water currents need to find a path everything has to stabilize which alone would take centuries if not tens of thousands of years but that is of course fiction even in your mind take a look at earths history nothing happens that fast except climate change which is going to be degrees of change over a hundred years this actually raises a question how long do you think terraforming will take will it happen in your life time in your daydreams how realistic are your expectations
his realm of study he did start off studying everything he now talks about but he has studied these things he has studied climate change extensively if was outside his realm of study once upon a time it is well within it now
the issue is not that we have not had melted ice before or a different atmosphere before hell earth was once a ball of molten rock the issue is that humans do nt breath very well underwater and we like to eat food every day and have a place to live climate change is happening far faster than it has historically and we would ideally like to live through it burying our head in the sand while the tide is coming in and saying its all happened before is suicide plain and simple the problem is you are not just killing yourself but everyone else with you
perhaps but with what kind of window days devil advocate from this point on sure but just because something has always been done that way does mean it right true but i think you missed my point your argument implies you against all international agreements that are negotiated in secret which is pretty much all of them do you oppose the iranian nuclear deal on the grounds that it was negotiated in secret and in practice there will be no public vote the negotiations will conclude and then the countries involved will ratify it end of process that ratification you just alluded to is the public vote that you allege wo happen you just contradicted yourself inside the span of a single sentence at no point will be the people who s lives are impacted by this agreement ever be given any say in it tpp has been in negotiation for years which means it actually was going on before the last election cycle so you already had elections happen since tpp has been a thing politicians fear being voted out of office so we still have leverage over whether they vote for it or not therefore if enough people voice their displeasure you still effect an outcome on the passage of tpp see sopa for example it a representative democracy not a direct democracy so we already had our say when we elected our current officials to congress and since everyone knows that the person they voting for deals with legislation like this judging your candidate position on trade deals should have been expected the corporations and politicians do not have our best interests in mind and we reject the entire premise of them dictating what happens in our countries to our lives politicians are doing the actual negotiations ustr negotiators sites default files tpp lead politicians merely approve or deny it when it comes up for a vote if you want to make the argument that politicians are too corrupt to be trusted to make any legitimate decisions fine just realize that the logical extension of this premise sacrifices any legitimacy you think the us government has to make law for example somebody can use this to say the iranian nuclear deal to avoid war with iran is bad because politicians do have our best interest in mind so we should reject it or how about this one we should reject any new epa regulations to fight climate change because politicians do have our best interest in mind would you agree with that because that what you risk sacrificing with absolutist distrust of elected representatives disclosure for the record i do really support tpp nor do i oppose it i believe in making evidence based decisions so i think it best to wait for evidence rather than make arguments from ignorance or assumptions the lack of evidence based policy making is already a big enough problem like anti vaccinators gmos climate change denial etc regarding the corruption issue you brought up in the last bit i agree we do have campaign finance issues that need reform i personally think it does compromise legitimacy but not necessarily to the degree that it means the us ca enter international agreements
believe me i am no i live comfortably through frugality i have no argument against the health care bill the solution the republicans came up with was garbage but aca is garbage as well there is a better solution and i interested in finding it hillary was not how is the trump presidency making america more vulnerable to terror attacks because last time i checked he is trying to get the refugees settled in saudi arabia clinton wanted to bring many more of them here have terror attacks gone up or down in countries that took in substantial numbers of refugees those health care numbers are spurious a lot of the people getting insurance were people getting bumped to medicaid the number of practices that are even accepting medicaid is going down a lot of people are paying way more for their insurance and many have lost their insurance trade tariffs make sense if you are in a trade deficit which we are with multiple countries protectionism as a rule is not ideal bit we have to do something and more tax money out of me is not happening the epa is a ridiculous organization predicated on government overreach to solve a spurious problem i do deny climate change bit i know that the consensus is bullshit noaa is using altered scales and unverified data to predicate alarmist climate models that are consistently wrong and we are trillion in debt i happy to admit the guy is perfect but the sensationalist claims are helping
things like consuming less recycling more switching to renewable energy sources there s lots of little things individuals can do such as not eating as much red meat or walking cycling occasionally rather than always using a car you could even buy some solar panels for your house if you so inclined whether you think that humans are the main cause of climate change or a minor one it impossible to deny that we are playing a role in it either way we have a responsibility to change our behaviour to stop what we cause while it unrealistic to get people to all go carbon neutral we can all at least start by doing some small things on a global scale with billion people in the world small things can make some major change
lt all comments ooo q find in comments the so called doomsday vault in norway gets new seed deposits dozens of groups are trying to protect their crops from climate change the deposit will feature over seed samples from different groups the most to send their seeds to the svalbard global seed vault at one time environment in futurology by that almost as many foreign seed deposits my ex gf got during our last year together is she accepting all seeds asking for a friend this message was posted by a bot r transcribersofreddit wiki index grafeasgroup tor questions message the message
do worry climate change is coming your way
what do you think about the climate change i sometimes afraid letting my car engine running to get it cold are there people in texas complaining about that
if you read my whole rant i started off with going on about climate change and then trailed off into how the world is a capitalistic greedy horror show the way we place more value on economic profit over environmental protection and sustainability amongst many other things building a pipeline to transport oil that go through indigenous peoples sacred lands and their water sources fast fashion so that clothing companies make a lot we pay a fair amount and sweatshop workers labour hours a day for a wage that is barely enough to live off of making healthcare or pharmaceutical drugs overly expensive and available to only those who are more wealthy and can afford it etc the list can go on i blame money for a lot of issues not just environmental ones
one of the men is a lifelong stutter who was being bullied on live tv i actually thought he showed grace when his family was attacked he did attack back the other bullied interrupted accused and lied he said that insulin was cheaper than water it is and that shit is real life for american oh and he told white nationalists to standby his only defense was noun verb hunter biden because he has no defense of his record he does even understand that the judges he was crowing about are because mitch blocked all appointments of obama and frankly as a young person in america you should be afraid of the judges from the federalist society they will not rule on your behalf on student loan issues they will not rule on your behalf on food safety they will not rule on your behalf on climate they are anti regulation on a way that will profoundly change america but sure both sides edit changed to did stand by to standby since stand by is to watch and do nothing and standby is a military term to be ready
it a problem for the planet canada is on the planet also economic projections do prove anything the biggest issue with climate change is that we do know all the consequences
unwound is my favorite band as well i understand what adam point is in the tweet but even if we lived in the best conditions politically global warming would still come down to human excess hoping for individuals to change has had no effect unsurprisingly but for citizens in the industrial world imposing even just sensible rules in terms of the climate environment means curtailing comfort for a lot of them us so at the end of the day for me the issue is human behavior
climate change is naturally occurring we are just helping to speed up the process to what degree we are expediting things i not sure having grown up with the likes of al gore and his doomsday predictions never coming even remotely true and now aoc with her even more outlandish claims and policies i already extremely skeptical add that to the fact that america is already one of the cleanest countries out there while china and india are allowed to operate relatively unscathed as for the whole sex vs gender debate why should i care i not going to ask you for your preferred pronouns you can tell me if you want me to use different ones aside from that who cares you free to fuck who want of legal age you free to marry who you want of legal age none of this means i personally have to agree with your idea of sexuality or gender or whatever chances are we never meet if we do meet we probably wo have to talk to each other if we do have to talk to each other it be business related so it still wo matter
the one thing all of the models agree on is that if we do change what we doing we fucked different models disagree on exactly how badly fucked but all agree on fucked there is no climate model which says we are fine and do need to change anything
i thought climate change was bad but maybe it good actually the us ca invade a country that already underwater think about it
what psychological science can offer to reducing climate q
hopefully not another boomer there is a massive generational gap when it comes to making a push regarding the urgency of climate change they need someone like jenica atwin to take the helm
yeah i agree i see the verysmartness of it but it does apply pretty well to people climate change deniers who ignore science and act like they won because they too stubborn to look at facts
i am pointing out that even though the majority of climate change deniers are american republicans it does mean that american republicans are the only people who can possibly deny climate change and yet you could only produce example yet insist republicans are nt the exclusive proponents of this idiocy that it i simply pointed out a few democrats as an early attempt to prove this point you produced example and total counting people not in office what you did was illustrate my point that global warming denial is a republican idiocy just answer one question if climate change denial is exclusively republican then how do you explain non american climate change deniers the world is on board global warming is real and man made its fringe to be antiscience in the rest of the world unlike on united states and the gullible people denying global warming elsewhere are most likely consumers of republican antiglobal warming propaganda but these fringe people not elected to power are not relevant keep pushing your false equivalency dude
billions of dollars do disappear into thin air to pay for the rover they go into the pockets of thousands of engineers and scientists working on the rover and every component of it piloting it interpreting the data it sends back scientific missions like this allow our society to have more highly trained technical staff these are technical staff that can then go work on other projects including things like tackling climate change pollution sustainable farming etc high cost scientific missions are exercise they keep society science and engineering faculties healthy strong and up to date increasing our ability to solve problems in other areas and that to say nothing of the science learned from these missions mars rovers study planetary science earth is a planet we can apply the science we learn on mars to earth and that to say nothing of the engineering advancements that result from these space missions
thanos with one hand he created a united globe and saved planet earth from overpopulation and climate change
crazy talk no way climate change could affect the earth geography they are totally unrelated
climate change is real but this is a firm example of climate change being real there have been funky days weeks going back hundreds of years
their entire effort is to make the topic of climate change two sided when it is in fact only one sided
depends on their powers but they would necessarily have to fight against deforestation or climate change they could use their powers to plant trees or find technology to supplement our fossil fuel industry they could also use their powers and intellect to make incredible wealth to basically buy out the industries responsible for environmental degradation a lot of comics have an explicitly evil antagonists for the heroes to fight whereas climate issues does really have that its the product of market forces and wasteful technology that we all participate in a hero would need to fix that
the disappearance occurs when the concentration of in the simulated atmosphere reaches parts per million a level that fossil fuel burning could push us past in about a century under business as usual emissions scenarios just posting the qualifier of that headline the article of course does bring it up but we will almost certainly not continue current levels of fossil fuel use all the way up through absolutely no one within the energy industry predicts that edit even a blog dedicated to information about the environment and climate change says we need to take a deep breath after reading that article
i not sure the left is overeacting generally at least that is could be catestrophic sea levels rising significantly would displace hundreds of millions if not billions of people as most people on earth live in coastal areas as are most of the largest cities if we think we have a migrant crisis now just wait till then but all science disagreements aside even if your perspective on outcomes is accurate i think the problem lies in the politicisation of the issue which in tern causes the polerization as seen in your chicken little analogy the left has an incentive to make the case for climate change as strong as they possibly can even to the point of being dishonest because they are the party that supports action against climate change therefore the right has an incentive to do the opposite to take away as much steam as possible from the left it sort of like how politicised the gun control debate is every time there a shooting the left has an incentive to make as big a deal out of it as possible in order to play on the emotions of people who might otherwise vote right and the right has an incentive to downplay it for the same reasons even though if it was a political issue you probably see both sides equally sympathetic to the issue since nobody wants people to be shot regardless of your views on guns
maybe you not from the us of a but they are indeed a hive mind here still you have not answered the question you have friends i sure who identify as conservative or at least are acquainted with some who deny climate change what evidenced convinced you that did convince them
i do agree that media ownership has gotten out of hand since the fcc has continued to allow such disproportionate ownership but i also think people get their news and such through a myriad options and many are not considered news outlets look at the current rightwing their false beliefs are not coming from most of those outlets and yet they continue to make false claims about masks covid vaccines climate change etc i agree we need to better inform and educate the voters but term limits does address this
no offense but this is kind of a shoddy argument you basically suggesting that we go out and solve every other major problem in the world easy enough and then everyone will just magically care about climate change because they be living in some utopia where it the only problem complete fantasy it basically disguised whataboutism the people who are actively campaigning for action on climate change usually have enough time and resources to do so and it a good thing they do no one is expecting villages in ethiopia to start organising against climate change right now
but i not too sure how good the racing will be it would be a shame if we end up with a boring race this year but on the other hand i do think that this should be a criteria by which we evaluate rate zandvoort it an amazing and unique track with a great history as you pointed out the changes that were made look very promising and the history of the track also has been respected rather well in my opinion if we indeed will end up with a boring race then i think it really ought to be in the best interest of the sport to have a honest discussion about the cars and regulations rather than declaring the track itself to be unfit for cars while it may be true that zandvoort is a great fit for modern cars i feel like it one of the tracks that should be a great fit for as a sport and the sport overall should relish going to tracks the likes of zandvoort another one that would be great to have on the calendar again is kyalami it a shame we do have a race on every continent at the moment let change the cars to have a wider range of tracks that they can race on if that means slower lap times so be it if we are chasing fast lap times above all else we might as well bring back tc and abs go back to lighter cars be it by changing the engine regulations allowing more engines per season or other changes open up the regulation to more active aero etc there are plenty ways of making current cars faster in terms of lap time so any argument against changes that improve racing but result in slower lap times lower cornering speed etc should include more than just appealing to the platitude that we can not go back to slower cars it not as if indycar or other series are right up there with in terms of lap times there plenty of room in between current lap times and lap times in other series for future cars higher cornering speeds and fast lap times are the ultimate measure of driver skill the regulations in many ways are an attempt at fixing the cars rather than pretending everything is fine with modern cars and just going to a select few circuits that allow for overtaking and i think that a really positive sign that overall seems to acknowledge the issues with the current cars whether the changes go far enough remains to be seen but zandvoort will be a track where we might be able to see how much of a difference the regulations will make once we get there in the regulation change is mainly trying to address dirty air making it hard to follow and overtake which is one key aspect that needed to be addressed however they do seem to address other problematic areas much such as for instance the weight of the cars admittedly not an easy problem to fix if we are to keep the hybrid pus which we will seeing as how much money has been put into over the last few years and overall political climate within and outside of the sport tires are another area that really ought to be looked at properly
trololo it global climate change now cuz global warming theory was wrong so nana nana boo boo
i believe discussion whether climate change is real caused by humans etc is a constructed narrative blown out of proportions to divert discussion from regulations and actual solutions companies like it when we discuss with a vocal minority instead of discussing solutions which would hurt short term profits
but science does occur in a vacuum it politicised from the beginning from its historical roots to modern funding if research is spending public money then it understandable that policy should inform but not dictate research for example prioritising research into clean energy climate change addressing food shortages instabilities all of those are political aims
thanks for sharing i do know his name and i ca be sure it the same guy white nationalist scum all look so similar but the guy in the first picture with mustache looks like the guy who screamed at me when i dared ask what his solution was to climate change as they protested oregon doing at the capitol last spring i suggest we kill half the people on the planet he seemed to be the ring leader for the group as the others stood behind him while he screamed i asked if any of them had different ideas and they stood silent
bold of you to assume the world wo nt be dead by climate change in years
do you believe members of congress should be condoning acts of terrorism and acts of violence against the government to accomplish the change they want to see in our current political climate link of her talking and condoning acts of terror against the united states
it true that many feel that way but when a gigawatt scale nuke does turn on and starts churning out a billion carbon free watts for the next years that a huge impact on climate nuclear today in the usa accounts for of our carbon free energy in france they decarbonized their entire grid in years with nukes and today are the lowest carbon major industrialized country because of it there have been some boondoggle nuclear builds for sure but if we get serious about climate and decide to pick a standardized nuclear design and just churn them out we absolutely know for a fact we can prevent climate change with nuclear the abwr for example can and has been built fairly recently in less than months
democrats are done i consider myself a progressive and i know very few people who consider themselves democrats for the last years it always been guns and abortions sprinkled with gay rights whenever it was popular do get me wrong this are important issues but not the only issues all this while wages stay the same wall street gets a bailout college tuition go up climate change coming to fruition but noooo vote blue or someone in the midwest can get a gun
he playing the long game waiting for climate change
not having children is a much larger impact
liberal and competent federal justices stopping ice raids and separating kids from their parents holding russia and other authoritarian dictators accountable getting back into the paris climate accord removing betsy devos from secretary of education and better funding for schools restoring more funding for child poverty support programs recognizing climate change again restoring the epa clean air and water standards ruth bader ginsburg
the metaphor is pretty easy to understand as they nearly spell it out the kaiju show up because human polution has nearly accidentally terraformed the earth and they here to finish the job every kaiju is rated on a category scale which mimics the hurricane scale they also each get a name heck they explicitly compare kaiju to hurricanes the ineffective solution is to build a giant wall or dike on the coast so the kaiju are metaphors for climate change meanwhile godzilla was a metaphor for the atomic bomb while king kong is steeped in colonialist perceptions of the east
from wikipedia in harris interactive surveyed randomly selected members of either the american meteorological society or the american geophysical union for the statistical assessment service stats at george mason university the survey found agreed that global temperatures have increased during the past years say they personally believe human induced warming is occurring and agree that currently available scientific evidence substantiates its occurrence only believe that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming and believe global climate change poses a moderate to very great danger at consensus rate it not really an issue that scientifically debated the only academic bodies opposed to agw are groups either funded by or directly associated with the petroleum industry
you can minimize your impact on climate change and also be a voice for the oppressed with your dollars and votes i believe in you
i agree that tech companies and others shut down legitimate discourse on alternate theories and that only feeds the flame of the conspiracy theorists i think this is a reaction to trump who parroted the china virus racist trope and that did help at all i personally put the lab leak hypothesis at likelihood there are some compelling evidence though no smoking gun yet i think it is also ineptitude rather than a cabal machinations to consolidate power i also think that some of the restrictions put by governments lack scientific basis but they throwing everything and the kitchen sink i think unfortunately we will be stuck with covid for a very long time to the point where it will become endemic seasonal as for peterson he fetishizes the individual and personal responsibility and spews misinformation on among many things climate change by being buddies with bjorn lomborg and other deniers he dislikes activists per se notwithstanding that gandhi mlk and lech walesa were all activists i understand his dislike because now activists are proponents of cancel culture and are younger so he may not consider them worthy sometimes society is so ossified that you need activists as catalysts to change the status quo that and his denial of the previous status of women and non europeans as objects of discrimination makes me think he has quite large blind spots personal responsibility is surely a good thing but not the be all end all i also think his illness has played a big part contrast jp from or years ago with now today jp is much angrier and looks much more emotionally and physically drained he was in recovery from his addiction issue got better but instead of taking time or go back to teaching at the ut he decided to dive right back in to the muck of the culture wars that is interfering behavior
i did see anyone at all claiming to believe in a flat earth until people started using that term to describe climate change deniers
canada was degrees a week ago d there is no guarantee that northern countries will be more resistant to climate change
with the reports on iran dire groundwater situation and the way water resources are being managed and decisions are being made by people who have very little respect for the planet and the people is there a future for progress and prosperity without a political transformation without major policy reforms we can not address many environmental problems including climate change water bankruptcy and biodiversity loss some policy reforms need radical efforts by the politicians when the society does not care about the environment or does can not put pressure on its politicians a radical shift is very unlikely that is why we need to focus on education societies and policy makers at the same time in my opinion focusing only on one side leads to a failure kaveh
human caused climate change is still well established by science denying one is the same as denying the other they are both true
the reproductive rate as more countries become better educated and economically prosperous has been dramatically dropping actually smarter people statistically have less children so as these countries like china and india go through their modernization periods the rates will drop even more they estimate we will plateau before billion or between that and billion the problems that are more immediate are climate change religion regressing societies and capitalist greed reaching peaks never seen before
doubt all you want let me quote some ridiculousness repeal the human rights act and withdraw from the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms spend an extra on defence annually withdraw from the political eu superstate repeal the uk climate change act stop funding the un international panel on climate change ban schools from using global warming propaganda such as al gore film an venient truth that not authoritarian whatsoever edit sarcasm retain devolved national assemblies but replace the representatives with westminster mps from the same nation the scottish msps welsh ams and in time northern irish mlas would be replaced with their westminster mps that one i strongly disagree with end the active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism scrap the misconceived human rights act scrap the nonsensical target of making of school leavers go to university why should everyone get the chance to excel academically sceptical stance on man made global warming claims i got to admit that one made me laugh oppose wind farms in general banning the burqa or veiled niqab in public buildings and certain private buildings why ca people have the freedom to express their own religion ukip supports designated smoking rooms in pubs clubs and public buildings ok this is a step backwards i could go on
from this website about us section nation overload is a conservative independent news media platform created to battle the corrupt incompetent corrupt globalist minded elite mainstream media in this divisive age of globalism vs nationalism mass migration climate change fanatics the misuse of big tech corp social media search engine algorithms the existential threat to lose our freedoms our nation state and our way of life has never been greater seems kinda ironic that r skeptic would just embrace anything that would come out of this source without a grain of salt it has all the hallmarks of a conspirationist news source including but not limited to citing cultural marxism as a thing
it is so much the authority telling the truth it questioning truth itself we have a president who will never acknowledge any coverage about his administration that he does like no matter how factual we have a populace that is splintered into their own echo chambers and one side that believes everything is fake news we live in an era where climate scientists are yelling at the top of their lungs that we need to address climate change and we have politicians and a good size of the country believing it to be a hoax and not real to put it simply my feeling is just as valid as your facts
it funny that a western activist is focusing on reaching the west what i find funnier is people getting more bothered by a teenage girl not doing everything as they imagine things should be done than they are bothered by politicians lying and misleading about the topic of climate change to benefit themselves
lol you a caricature of what the left says about the right one of the reasons most of the right is dumber than a box of rocks is because they self censor they wo listen to consensus of experts on subjects like evolution climate change health genetics etc and they want a world where facts will be censored from their children so they end up just as ignorant
there was alot of science what are you talking about they talked about genders climate change race etc
overconsumption is one of the leading causes leading to climate change and even the banks are now coming out and saying we need to liquidate the current spending model in order to save the economy in the future
you have not heard from a large number of scientists who do not have the funding or the support of their colleagues through risk of losing their careers in a field they love to research amp publish the alternative theories that would state climate change is not anthropogenic my father is a geologist who actually has a phd and there is no methodology to reproduce emission increases resulting in a greenhouse effect whether in a small scale lab experiment or a science project that kids can duplicate think of it this way it is not overwhelming evidence it is the only research being allowed citing ice core samples with a few hundred thousand years of chronology against the timelines of hominids being on this planet for millions of years talk about a data gap climate change delays the ice age and is a beneficial side effect of the gradual climate change increase that we can not change no matter how hard we try if we can not replicate the liberal narrative in any way shape or form the skeptics will always prevail
we already seeing vast areas of the great barrier reef here in aus dying off due to climate change amongst other reasons this is our problem not our grandchildrens
i not quite sure how jerry brown caused water shortages i literally just told you california had plans and money allotted to build levees and water reservoirs that would have supplied water up to million people even during a drought droughts are a known quantity in this state we did just discover them geological records shows this state is very drought prone going back thousands of years jerry brown literally ended the infrastructure projects that would ensure californians had enough water this is magic this is basic construction and management it been a problem well before he took office i talking about his first term as governor he came back and ran additional two terms recently which ironically his chickens came home to roost yet he was not held accountable for it why because he deflected to climate change and idiots believed him what other politicians fuck up on stuff like that and also are around to face the consequences of it yet he still was not held accountable for it democrats do not hold their politicians accountable for bad outcomes ca is less than years old so not sure where you are getting the fire and drought data but that a big inference geological data we can look at grounds soil water erosion tree rings etc to determine droughts and fires this is basic science if you unfamiliar with this think of carbon dating there are methods of determining what happened in the passed via different scientific methods ice core samples sediment and so on pat brown did develop a huge water project but it did deliver as much water as planned pat brown worked with republicans on plans as in ever expanding water infrastructure over a century as in they literally had it figured out in the and how to support million people in california given droughts they setup funding and yearly projects to increase and expand water resources jerry brown ended that in guess what happens when you gut infrastructure and your population keeps growing i do think reagan elected after him did anything i think you are fundamentally failing to understand what plans are it a yearly budgetary item and approval process that allows levees and dams to be built these were being worked on until jerry brown ended it then he sent the money else where reagan followed this budget item as it was agreed upon between democrats and republicans it was a bipartisan initiative reagan served two terms and left office before jerry brown in after jerry brown no one attempted to reverse the cuts as it was a large amount of money being distributed else where politicians what immediately pay off to constituents they rarely care about long term problems like this i will also note jerry brown failed to do any increases to water infrastracture this is a problem with growing capacity as well as maintaining current facilities dams like oroville are failing levees across central california were built in the and make new orleans looked advanced and new we have serious problems and democrats are doing nothing to fix them and when they fail because they will they will blame climate change i also believe climate change plays a role but i not sure if we talking kobe or kwame level lol or somewhere in the middle climate scientists are on record stating there is no evidence climate change paid a part droughts are a normal aspect as all bad weather has been around since the dawn of time of the california climate pat brown and republicans understood that when they laid out the plans
bernie considers global warming the most timely change to national security he opposed the manufacturing of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a notable effect on the climate bernie bot
i am not going back in time with bill and ted to shout to teddy roosevelt and the land barons of the era but it is still mismanagement and it caused the fuel accumulation and overall poor forest health that makes these fires so destructive and biome changing i take the judgement of cliff mass the well known climate change denier and right wing apologist over one journalist for the stranger and two of my fellow ok cty residents asking somebody whose house was burned over do you think it was dramatic chord climate change is just not helpful
so to make your analogy valid there must be a certainty that climate change will produce all of these disasters please point me to a single credible citation that calculates such a high certainty let me save you the trouble there is no such thing in fact the probability of these disaster scenarios ca be quantified because the actual impact of global temperature increase is still poorly understood at best scientists can brush with broad strokes like increased precipitation in some places decreased precipitation in others and more violent storms which one can trivially predict from the fact that higher temperatures equates to increased kinetic energy circulating in the atmosphere beyond that it all speculation informed speculation in many cases but the uncertainty is very very high because the data is almost nil
haha it actually more of only of something like a of academic papers that supported some idea of man made climate change so less than of academic papers in all support this notion and not all of those papers were written by experts in their fields but this really is pointless as i said you only will listen to points of view that are inline with your opinion anything else is conspiracy theory nonsense right
thanks i listened she saying decisions are made by those who show up which is accurate and that nobody else in federal politics has shown up with a climate change proposal which is also accurate i not seeing the problem
their donors own or profit from non renewable resources climate change deniers are just bought off con men clearly
australian here we did make this list because a the murray darling does reach the sea anymore and b we more into air pollution as the world largest coal producer our government is completely owned by the coal oligarchs and denies climate change
it not that socialism would magically solve the problem since obviously you could easily run an advanced democratic socialist society without giving a single fact about the environment it the fact that in a socialist society you could design a system of incentives regulations and infrastructure investments that will tackle climate change in a real effective way of course there potential to fuck it up but at least it possible you ca say the same about capitalism cause the entire system is built around perverse incentives that encourage endless growth destroying externalities ignoring or removing regulations and just generally not giving a fuck about the environment socialism is some magic solution to all of the world problems but it at least it can address problems that are profitable
yes because it can cause more things like hurricanes to form over time it could lead to some major changes in climate but this is the first time earth has had a major climate change ice age for example i have done anything to help cause i simply do care lol i be long dead before it starts to take a major effect
threads like this where it all boils down to fuck you i do want to adjust a single fraction of my life for climate change really dishearten me we might as well just admit that we as a society do give a shit about climate change but the next flooding topic then suddenly everyone is so sad that the climate is changing but doing anything about it fuck that
climate change actually
i sorry but this is partially wrong this strong hurricane season is related to non formations of el nino and la nina and most of us agree that this was non related to any kinds of climate change people want to believe is occurring you can forecast all you want for the future but there are trillions of factors we have to build into climate change studies we do even know what a day forecast will look like therefore we can never say what climates around the planet will look like in whatever amount of years if we had a weak hurricane season would it be correct to say that global warming was no longer happening no therefore we can not say we are having strong storms because global warming
why not just set up coal plants to make climate change happen rapidly and build an atmosphere
because that value does tell us the whole story the amount of heat is nearly as important as the atmospheric makeup of the planet if the atmosphere contained less greenhouse gasses or contained something else that reflects more heat than ours does then that extra heat would only serve to maintain an average temperature close to our own rather than heat things up our planet would be very cold if not for the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere about f colder climate change is worrying because we are adding to the gasses keeping heat in longer at a rate faster than what would otherwise naturally occur and therefore the planet natural controls are keeping up this leads to a slowly increasing temperature because the greenhouse gasses retain the absorbed heat longer than it otherwise would have without them this will continue until the global average reaches a new point of stability where the energy wiki is once again balanced it is able to reach a new balance because the energy gets radiated at a faster rate as temperature increases as shown wiki file eventually it would reach a point where the amount being radiated once again matches with the amount being absorbed retained and it will balance out that assuming we are still messing with it by adding more and more greenhouse gasses even if we stopped literally all greenhouse gas emissions right now we are going to still keep heating up for awhile of course it will be some time before we curb our emissions so the real question is whether or not we can stop our emissions enough to reach a balance that is too bad can be recovered from this is why scientists are so insistent about it because time is a factor and the politicians businesses getting in the way in the name of short term profit are only making things worse for everyone in the long run there are other concerns too about how heating up too much might cause pockets of frozen in ice or held in the oceans to be released possibly leading to a runaway greenhouse effect that is out of our hands to control that would probably be a mass extinction event albeit a very slow one the likelihood of that occuring though is up in the air
i inclined to agree the current conventional wisdom is that climate change is making hurricanes more intense but not more frequent and perhaps even less frequent it has been years since the last hurricane made landfall in new england which is the longest stretch since we started tracking but is certainly getting close
meat consumption is a huge contributor to climate change
literally everything any law that is updated to keep up with the ever evolving world we live in whether that be legal bribery or climate change laws or even general regulations and certain tax cuts for housing there is soo many around the world it is even funny i understand that they ca stay on top of every single little law but when they are actively finding loopholes whether that be for themselves or not stopping large companies for abusing loopholes that could be easily except for the part where they get bribed by said companies to not ammend said laws legally which is another law that needs to be ammended that is worse than simply neglecting to update some random law made in that they are no longer enforcing
i actually fairly underwhelmed by the intelligence and mental strength of the majority of humans myself included it not like we some enlightened race high above the intelligence of the rest of the animals on earth we are more intelligent but still not enough for us to be proud of it when i see stupid conservatives specifically people who follow based on blind faith instead of logic and deep thinking i know that i was one of them not too long ago and i know how they think sure i like to see more people change their ways but in my experience apart from myself i not met someone who even had an interest in such a thing even my deconversion did happen from online conversations or for any deep discussions with liberals it happened gradually as i was challenged in college by new information and i learned how to solve problems with logic instead of assuming that there was always an authoritative answer written somewhere also i shit on conservatives because they the ones in power right now and doing the most damage if things change and we end up with president bernie and congress is full of people like aoc i have no problem criticizing them and anyone who blindly follows them as well however that seems unlikely and i ca imagine either of those folks trying to disenfranchise their political opponents or being as corrupt as the republicans are furthermore climate change is an issue that trumps all other issues as the longer we wait to do anything the more probable society ending results happen
the issue of copying is certainly a barrier for many however the biggest issue with me as well as many others is that we currently have only the beginnings of an understanding of how consciousness memory and mind actually operate let alone how they generate personhood sometimes i wonder if the people who advocate for uploading and mind files are even human in the same way that i am i seen countless discussions about how creating a large base of personal factual information is a valid way to either reconstitute the person or to aid in doing so how is this credible for instance there is a belief that a fact is equal to a memory if write down or record my memories of things and events they are not the same as my memory or of my experience in recalling it personal memories in humans do not exist in isolation and they are not experienced as such i can make a mind file wherein i say that i like the smell of peonies but when i recall that fact it is invariably accompanied by a vast reservoir of other memories and associations which are not present just as facts but which trigger an avalanche of other remembered things some as sights sounds and whole narratives as well as the attached emotional meaning i may see my mother picking peonies our garden when i was years old with the sun shining with my dog tinkerbell cavorting nearby indeed all my consciousness as it interacts with my memories is like this and if i were to continue down this path of thought and remembering vast swaths not of facts about my life but of how i actually experienced it will emerge all intricately connected and interacting indeed my consciousness itself is emergent from the actions of myriads of sub mind processes operating below the threshold of my perception you can take all the facts about me you like that i a man that i learned how to ride a bicycle with training wheels and even which hand i masturbate with and all you will ever get as a result is mass of facts which is about as much me as any photograph of me are that this would even remotely constitute personhood or that it could aid in restoring personhood it is perceived as naive at best this makes contemporary pronouncements that persons they can be operated on different substrate using different means and substituting scraps of information in the form of facts for the memories they are indicative of seem hubristic irresponsible and premature people know how to hairdryers yet i would be very doubtful about investing in a new company to make them the point here is that people are quite rightly skeptical of new enterprises using proven technology to create proven products because they know intuitively or otherwise that there are huge unknows in any such undertaking that ca be eliminated except by doing them which is a risky proposition people who assume mind uploading are in a far worse position because unlike as is the case with hairdryers it has been done yet such advocates may well point to what they consider proofs of principle that like the difference between the publication of tsiolkovsky rocket equation in and tsiolkovsky trying to sell you a ticket to the moon we made it to the moon years later but two generations have come and gone since then and we have been back why well lots of reasons most of them unforeseen and unforeseeable by tsiolkovsky the human space travel singularity happened in the and yet here we are wise people which is very often very different from smart people understand this kind of thing when i was a boy in the very smart people went around the country telling kids like me that the cost of electricity would the cost of metering it this would come about due to nuclear energy in the another very smart man eric drexler tried to sell me a similar line about nanotechnology while i thought a lot of drexler technological insights i thought his utopian ones were the same kind of foolish nonsense i had heard when i was years old if nuclear power got stalled because of its wicked and dangers downsides well then the dangers and downsides of nanotechnology make those associated with nuclear power seem like child play by comparison my own rule of thumb is that the power of any technology is at least inversely proportional to the amount of mayhem it can cause sometimes we get a long breathing spell between actions and consequences as has been the case with fossil fuels and climate change but sooner or later the hazards must be confronted and dealt with wise people understand this about uploading and cryonics aside from their speculative nature these technologies are also extremely mischievous and that is going to delay them or prevent them in ways we can only begin to imagine cryonics posits that if we have sufficiently conserved the structure that encodes the person we may be able to recover that person that requires a colossal leap of faith in and of itself and overwhelmingly most smart wise or otherwise people do not find this reasonable while i not and never have been an advocate of selling cryonics like hair dryers or toasters and to as many people as buy these products many others are it should thus be obvious that they will get nowhere even faster than they already have by not only asking people to buy a ticket to the moon but to go by transporter instead do be the red queen who said when i was younger i always did it for half an hour a day why sometimes i believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast it asking enough and apparently too much of people to believe just one
i talking about agenda in the political sense not in the nefarious conspiracy sense in politics there are constantly situations in which political agenda and party line do not align with scientific findings we seen a lot of this on the right with climate change covid vaccines etc but it not like the left is safe from these issues
i had posted in the sub before and found that thread with the search bar how would you feel if the topic were vaccines or climate change instead
climate change is the biggest issue facing the planet right now so honestly i do really care what else they believe as long as they help stop climate change first
but this society is clearly one they do like considering they are trying to change it i like to know what they actually want the government to do their website is wishy washy our demands the irish government and media must adequately inform the public of the climate and biodiversity emergency and communicate the urgency for change and the consequences of not doing so the irish government must act to immediately halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by while reversing all policies not in alignment with that position all policy changes must be in keeping with the ideas of a just transition where the most vulnerable are not expected to sacrifice the most this just transition must be made within a global context and ensure that profits are not placed before our planet they talk about policy change let get some examples then what do they want changed how is that going to impact on everyones lives are they willing to deal with the impacts are the majority of people willing to deal with the impacts i do think anyone can support this group when there so little information on their ideals are they looking to save the planet at all costs if so they be in favour of halting immigration shutting down most of dublin airport sending farmers to the dole queue refusing any more data centers being built in ireland

climate change is coming
despite what you might think it possible to believe in climate change without being a fear monger about it i neither in denial nor ignorant about the matter climate change is real and is a big problem i just think your apocalyptic prediction is radical and it makes me and undoubtedly countless other people not take you seriously
what do we have here some people commenting on the relative importance of both subjects climate change sceptics using words like bullshit fucking dumbasses rofl lol full retard scaremongering idiots silly billys and various insults draw your own conclusion about the intelligence of both groups
do forget it used to be called global warming that was working then it was called climate change now it actually called extreme weather because with extreme weather you ca miss as someone who kind of a dumbass i ca even imagine being this stupid
most certainly not the surge in the polls for the greens is largely down to the failing international battle against climate change people were triggered by the draught in the summer the diesel scandal feinstaub etc they have a moderat stance on migration but are not campaigning on it no party with a serious interest in gaining vote in the next elections does
i love how the same segment of the population that loves to yell but science says about anything abortion related also denies that climate change is real
climate change would be a good way to do that
i do nt think you realise how seriously these people take the issue of climate change if you honestly think they have considered the dangers of protests like this i know its easier if you pretend that these people are so stupid that they think there no danger in protesting on an active race track but all it really shows is that you do actually care about looking into what the protesters actually say about what they say
the elephant in the room is the list of signatories over ten psychologists and philosophers ten writers editors three seti guys three doctors and tv presenter bill nye an additional four signatories are from committee for skeptical inquiry itself composed significantly of psychologists i do really know what to say here it is just too damn funny seeing you guys congratulate yourselves over this
i likely be downvoted for this but whatever he does deny the fact that climate change is happening or anything he is saying that it is being exaggerated and that it occurs in natural cycles he thinks global warming supporters are putting the blame on humans while he believes the majority of the change comes from natural forces i not for or against the argument he says i just wanted to clarify what he really means because people on reddit love to circle jerk omg he thinks global warming is real and that the earth is changing which simply is true
i a conservative and i voted for trump you say we as if you know me or that you assume i automatically agree with you because i on reddit you are wrong on nearly everything you said about conservatives you are buying the narrative that they are selling to you but it not the truth i agree on climate change i do buy the liberal plan i want secure borders and i fluently bilingual and have lived among mexican immigrants in the fields of ca i know what i talking about but you just assume so stop and listen you never acquired as to what i believe you replied without attempting to listen you never considered the other person you were talking to and that is precisely the point being made you made me a villain before you found out a damn thing about me
yeah i very impressed with bridenstine i just think it funny ironic that in my own opinion the two best nasa administrators we had have been a former ss officer and a former climate change denying tea party politician sort of shows how competence comes from unexpected places
muh facebook copypasta clickbait science i still remember hearing forever about how blood is blue without oxygen that why veins are blue which fundamentally does even make sense there so random internet science bullshit like that that people immediately believe because they believe in science people used to copy paste about how black holes were wormholes etc they pretty much anti vaxxers speaking of which i seen more anti vaxxer shit from liberals than conservatives science bans people for posting peer reviewed scientific research that refutes the damage accuracy of climate change models and predictions or that transgenderism is linked to mental illness we believe in that science but not this science
it really depends in todays climate the left is very much agree with me or you canceled the newer i do seem to do their research but rather just agree with whatever they are told to believe point being your liberal to anti vaxxer comment just because someone does want one shot does mean they are anti vax nor does it mean that anyone who is right conservative republican is anti vax i consider myself a realist which leans a bit more right libertarian my fianc√© is more liberal as is his family mine is more conservative libertarian a fair amount of things my fianc√© and i agree on but there are still things we do i told him i did want to vote in the last election because neither candidate deserved to be president but if i had to choose it would be biden he took great offense to this where it lead to a few mildly heated discussions people can change and evolve as they are exposed to new things experiences and new prospectives
because if you did closely follow early stages of republican presidential primaries or lived in utah maaaaybe a neighboring state you were going to hear about him he a good guy though part of a dying breed in a lot of ways unfortunately if you looking for a current governor with a similar mindset brian sandoval of nevada is one of my favorite right wing politicians currently serving edit to expand on sandoval imagine if you can a pro science republican who supports abortion rights immigration reform and a path to citizenship green energy and climate change prevention increased education funding but brings fiscal conservative responsibility and cut his own pay when he proposed a state employee pay cut if that sounds appealing to you you may understand how he won over support in his reelection campaign
climate change is real because it cold in my house right now
you must be a little kid if you do realize that global warming climate change has been mainstream discussion for the past several decades greta does even move the needle not being heard lol what the fuck are you talking about have you missed the decades of legislation on carbon emissions
no i actually saying that i know where those numbers are sourced from and the surveys are a lie do you think climate change is concerning supports a green new deal the methodology of surveys are complete nonsense
own as little as possible my rule is to always start with one the rule of ones pick one of anything one pen one seam ripper one dish one dress one notebook is that enough will one do it for you if not pick one more of the thing can you live with two forks two t shirts two pens rinse and repeat stop when you have the smallest amount of anything that you need for comfort or necessity without compromising effort and ease of use get rid of what left if you need t shirts then you need them but owning will take more energy space time and money to keep than owning five or one that inventory rule is a good one how much energy do you want to expend how much space are you willing to give over to stuff the less you own the less time you clearing washing folding and organizing do have hidden shit it okay to have a box containing many smaller like items like an office box with some stamps a few envelopes a stapler pen and pencil refills whatever i keep a zipper bag of my most used sewing tools and carry the bag to and from the table so its convenient but it not helpful to stuff as much as you can into a cabinet or drawer so you ca nt see everything or you end up fighting with your stuff to get something out or put it back that not a good long term strategy and leads to clutter in open rooms because you made it too difficult to put stuff back manage your waste stream people on here are complaining about throwing shit in a landfill if you have the options learn about them in your community some people ca do this for a variety of reasons and that okay or they do nt want to do it which is okay too we ca nt impact climate change individually but if you concerned about tossing stuff figure out alternatives once you declutter and your household is more manageable you can start looking at this aspect of your life and generate far less trash if that a goal for you
recycling a tin can is pretty much pointless while the leader of one of the world largest pollutants thinks climate change is a chinese hoax the sheer scale of the problems require state level international cooperation and so the most effective thing you can do is help to advance the environmental movement so that it becomes more politically mainstream
why are they idiots i mean people who say global warming may be wrong but at least they are not deniers or people who claim that climate change is natural and humanity has nothing to do with it
tiny amounts of adaptation do not add up to reptiles turning into mammal that is what i have been taught evolution is by science teachers the same ones who said a small rat turned into a massive whale are you saying that is false it seems evolution would need to have a completely stable environment for billions of years to be able to successfully make these small changes but we not that has happened with the regular cycles of climate change every few thousand years causing freezing or extreme heat the climate has change far faster than any animal could adapt
your initial message conveys that humans influenced climate change not caused it influence comes across to readers that climate change is not serious or that we humans do nt have a large impact for why climate change is damaging to the planet or why it is happening regardless of your intent of the message its meaning could be misinterpreted that humans play a small role the alcohol statement is an analogy to influence to show that influencing something is just as bad as causing something if you do nt know what an analogy is its definition is below essential meaning of analogy a comparison of two things based on their being alike in some wayhe drew made an analogy between flying a kite and fishing he compared flying a kite to fishing he said that flying a kite was like fishing the act of comparing two things that are alike in some waycoining new words by analogy to with existing ones coining new words so that they are formed in a way similar to old by analogy
i truly do understand the rich person endgame do they really not realize that if climate change kills all the poor people chances are better than good that it will also kill the rich people unless there is some secret underground megabunker or space ship station they plan to abscond to when the shit really hits the fan even still once all the rich people were in such a place they still need people to grow food and make clothes and shit who gon na do it them do they think they be able to bring slaves with them slaves that wo revolt and slit their throats in their sleep or blow up the whole fucking place
even though it might not look like it the future is bright with our generation in the lead we may be able to fix climate change and start a colony in space mars or the moon our technology will further improve the quality life and i know this all seems quite big and not personal and well that the point just keep pushing through and you be able to experience these opportunities accomplishments and more the world needs whether you know it or not
i not gon na give a douche university level instructions on how to interpret statistical data because it would be a pointless waste of my time denying the seriousness of covid at this point is like denying climate change or gravity or the shape of the globe it does not dignify a rational debate there i put it more clearly since your reading comprehension seems to be as terrible as your statistical interpretation
global warming is still an accurate phrase conservatives changed it to climate change to make it seem less scary and deserving of action
i disagree i believe the oil companies cause is much worse gun violence will never kill as many people as climate change will
i not necessarily disagreeing with you but your explanation of it and how you related it to climate change was quite bad
there a petition signed by like scientists that stating climate change is not man made almost a of which have the consensus studies only include scientists who have published papers that posit climate change as being man made even retired nasa scientists will tell you climate change is cause by fluctuations in solar activity edit side note the epa recently stated that air quality is getting cleaner however the air quality was already getting cleaner before the epa even existed so they just taking credit for a trend that was already occuring

this is a clickbait headline for another half assed article from huffpo i not denying the natural world is in crisis but i doubt huffpo actually cares and this article was just a laundry list of all the problems nature faces today i not at all certain that in absolute effect this is worse than climate change and the article does really actually clarify that point either anyway if huffpo really does have such a deep concern for the environmental crisis whether it climate change habitat loss or whatever let see them put their money where their mouth is surely such a large website uses a massive amount of energy every day where is their renewable energy promotion their carbon offsets what are they doing at all to fend off these crises

the climate is a highly dynamic system so how could anyone say that change in climate is real it only constant is change there are respectable voices speaking out about the dodgy science being bandied about it would seem that climate change is specifically a tool of politicians

a lot going on in this post the paris accord set emission guidelines for the world that if fully achieved may prevent about degrees of warming proponents would argue it a necessary step and worth the cost opponents would argue that the cost is disproportionate and excessive i think strong arguments can be made for both points of view my personal opinion is that it is more symbolic than practical as it is non binding and ultimately does not make a significant impact on the future of climate on your first point i think you bring up some important points effective climate policy is going to require public buy in and legislation like the gnd does not do the movement any favors imho you joke that it is about exterminating cows but a lot of people view it that way silly overly burdensome too broad we need policy proposals that make economic sense and are understandable before we can get public support policy proposal that call for the immediate say within a decade or two elimination of natural gas fracking which has driven the recent decrease in us emissions should be non starters conversely eliminating coal within the next decade might make sense if we can replace much of it with natural gas and renewables on your second point this is more of an issue of the media activists doing a poor job of reporting on science than an issue with the science if your knowledge of climate change was what you saw in al gore the inconvenient truth you may feel like someone is trying to pull the wool over your eyes given that there is still ice in the arctic and manhattan is underwater the thing is that documentary and many of these wild predictions are not well representing the underlying science this also does no favor for the movement on your third point i would really say living in a solar powered house for a week experiencing renewable energy per se it did show you the problem of intermittency no doubt anyone who is trying to sell the idea that we can power the world today with wind and solar is not providing you the full picture this just is a thing yet but that is to say it wo be one day it is very hard to have a conversation around climate change because it has become such a political topic discussing it in a productive way requires us to get over that but i ca say i am particularly hopeful of that happening anytime soon
the purpose is encouraging supporters of punitive measures to prevent carbon emissions to improve their messaging you might be in the wrong place then because i do think punitive measures to prevent carbon emissions is something that anybody is proposing in this thread or the underlying court case emissions have to come down and i believe i speak for a majority when i say i less worried about the burden of those emissions being allocated in a way to punish people than i am of people shirking their fair share by claiming they being punished leading by example is not an argument unless other countries will actually follow that not actually true we ca control the us hungary china brazil or any of the other countries with autocratic climate change denying leaders we can control only our own national response to forego doing what we as a nation are supposed to do just because others wo or might do what they supposed to do is not just irresponsible it bad policy for example we do endorse protectionism just because other countries default on their trade obligations and the irish economy has reaped significant benefits from this policy if the world ends because america and other such countries did do what they should have then it will end no matter what we do but if we reduce our emissions and do our part at least we can say that we did do what we should have we wo be consigned to lamenting how we let the worst of the world leaders drag us down to our level we will at least be able to point to how we were different from them instead of leaving ourselves vulnerable to the nagging suspicion that deep down we no better than the idiots and autocrats i will support all sensible measures to slow climate change excellent the highest court in our country has just held that the government proposed response was insufficiently sensible when weighed against the unenumerated constitutional and eu law rights of its citizens maybe in a thread discussing the case we could talk about that instead of observing that it might be pointless to do anything at all because the yanks ca so much as agree on the colour of paper
i m actually very happy about this which is my usual disposition i been here for years on various accounts in anarchist and leftist subs and i never saw this level of recognition before no news articles or interviews but now we have a voice however soft it is still people are waking up and our ideas are gaining traction if we successfully engage with our fellow wage slaves about the day to day problems never losing sight of our goal agitate and talk with people in years we might see things change i know that might sound disheartening but remember the anarchists in spain started distributing propaganda and organizing the workers and peasants in the late and did see the fruits of their labor until the you are all doing important work even if it does seem so now you are laying the foundation for hopefully if climate change does kill us all a new and beautiful society built in the shell or ashes of the old we can do this we can help our brothers and sisters in the world and make a life worth living for everyone with no hierarchy and no more of this oppression and slavery i appreciate all you people on here do irl and on the internet and shoutout to jacktherah for putting in work like they do do lose heart folks it one of the only things we got left protest wheat paste agitate form self organized unions riot take a shit on the clock write prisoners feed the homeless start a free store in your community make art make music make love live in the moment if only for a moment and never forget there nothing as beautiful as a brick in a cops face i love all edit i think it also important to stay vigilant against corporate infiltration and make sure our message stays the same as before with the new influx of users this will bring we ca afford to be watered down the words anti work should be on everybody tongue in years we frequently hit the front page of reddit and we should compromise our ideas but we should meet people where they at and help our fellow workers but not just them shoutout to my differently abled folks i reiterate we can do this again i drunk but i love all you the fucking best and i glad i still here and not dead yet from drugs alcohol or suicide thank each and every one of you for just existing
off the top of my head i wonder if there much difference between home heating cooling vs that provided by employers i worked at some places that did provide adequate heating for employees which was made even worse by huge rooms and high ceilings so all employees had to wear winter clothes inside meanwhile at home our place was so cozy and set up with a much more intelligent climate control design that we always felt very comfortable with fairly little energy use age cubic space of the work place vs number of employees would probably give you a better idea of how well a heating in particular would help for cooling some places only offer a fan while others use actual air conditioning which tend to leak harmful gasses over time for would be altered by what kind of food is prepared and how it prepared for example i usually bring left overs from a home cooked meal for my work lunches so for me little if anything would change if a company focuses on mostly providing plant based foods there might be a significant decrease but most places i worked usually left us to our own devises so my coworkers would usually bring their own food leftovers or drive to a nearby fast food place then these sound like data you want to work out by area for sure since there vastly different weather electric grid compositions and levels of access to eco friendly transit depending on where people live i think even the average distance people travel to work can vary drastically where i grew up in the uk most people could walk to work or grab a train very few people i knew had cars and still do while people in the usa often tell me they drive hours one way for work which indicates a multitude of hurdles for them to fix for which wfh could be a key element in tackling also for the number of people per household question there the additional issue of would they turn off the temperature when going to work some people turn theirs down or off but if the whole family is home and loses one person who goes to work at a place that is only warmed cooled because people are expected at work there i going to have to dig around and see what i can share on the topic i read some really great stuff about bike to work programs a few years back which i feel could contribute to the discussion since biking reduces emissions and increases overall rider health edited to account for weird numbering automation
not really he said that he thought climate change data was being distorted and politicized and that the science behind our views on climate change was weak he was wrong on both counts incidentally but he was one of those people who believed in a secret cabal who manufactured fake data in an effort to trick the world and the like his view was that the data was being interpreted right and that people following the common view of the data were just jumping on the bandwagon and he argued that consensus is publication for earth day michael crichton explains why there is no such thing as consensus he also did outright deny climate change but rather said that it was unknowable just what kind of an effect we were having on it certainly not a mainstream view and i think he was wrong in his views this michael crichton and global does a good job of rebutting him but not to the point where i think it would be accurate to call him a climate change denying conspiracy theorist
maybe you did see the end of the data global warming is a statistical difference look at the past years every part of the us was much hotter than average that not a weather change that a climate change
a major impact on our generation is by no means being a climate change denial
yeah as much as i have always loved his work i ben disappointed that it took him so long to finally start openly pushing for large scale conservation i remember an interview or possibly comment portion in one of his series back in the or early where he said that he was skeptical of human influence in climate change and that he avoided converting it in his documentaries when he finally did start talking about it a few years ago and everyone was singing his praises for doing so my main thought was you probably would have had a much bigger impact if you had done this years ago i glad he is doing so now and growing up with his nature documentaries is part of why i a conservation ecologist but he sure did take his time about it
you feel anxious because you feel helpless you feel like there nothing you can do to sway the course of things that you just reacting to events you need to be proactive to feel in control the most proactive thing you can do is to extract yourself from the system because it a systemic problem it not easy to do entirely but try to take small steps towards living less through the financial structures that are causing climate change grow cook bake as much of your own food as you can when you buy it buy organic and local buy as little as you can from major corporations buy second hand as much as possible barter where possible avoid buying anything that comes in disposable packaging take public transport walk or ride whenever possible reconsider the need to fly or drive places try to stay out of debt build your local community make friends share things locally get involved in a local currency all of theses things have the benefit of making you more resilient in a crisis and weakening the system that is the problem climate change is already happening and you not dead yet it will affect different places in different ways and at a different times even then not everyone will always be affected protesting is well and good it brings attention to the issue which is important but it difficult to protest against a system that you are dependent upon
exactly instead he says he read books on climate change and the literature on climate change but he can not be sure about it because he can not distinguish between politics and the data you have to ask yourself how bad he is at interpreting academic english can he read the graphs or are they tainted with politics now if someone claims to have read books on climate change plus they have read the studies i definitely expect such a person to have a good grasp of the facts and the politics at play instead he says oh it complicated and we do know for sure and then he normally goes on about how pathetic green options are etc
it worse because they said the distance increase would be permanent i disabled used to play mostly from my car they changed the distance added remote raids let me stock up on items walking my dogs i use a mobility scooter in the morning when it not too hot for me to be out then play mostly from home i not going back to playing from my car i exercise less if i planning on driving ca risk being too dizzy also we currently have major climate change related disasters around the globe i do drive unless it necessary to pick up my kids or go to infusions doctors appointments

fuck all first world countries virtue signaling about their concern for the environment climate change when in fact these bastards are exporting their trash to other countries like the us uk canada who else
pretty sure it not that he does have a closet of nice suits like the rest of the representatives but that he is a making a statement there are other nations that often wear their historically traditional clothing when they want to make a statement but i think png has the most attention grabbing traditional attire png is one of the nations that is going to be totally by climate change when a man or woman with an ivy league or oxford education shows up dressed like this it makes a serious statement it also a real fuck you to everyone else who is conforming to the cultural and societal leadership of the western nations that are destroying our environment like there is no tomorrow
finally some sense in this thread a lot of people forsake cows as being the problem when in fact there are way more impactful ways to help the environment local produce the petrol that burned every year in international shipping is much worse than all of the cows farting i assume you mean international shipping of food since you only mentioned produce could you link a source to that claim a solid used car and drive it for a decade at least you can learn anything you want on youtube including how to drive properly and not burn through your clutch every miles you can alsolearn about preventative maintenance your car running smoothly for easily miles it goes back to looking after your shit you do need a new car every years would also be interested in the numbers for this newer cars are generally more fuel efficient and better in terms of air pollution regarding climate change i not sure if the advantages of having outdated models on the streets outweigh the disadvantages if everyone genuinely took the time to assess just how wasteful their lifestyles are vegan or not they soon see that targeting cows and chickens as some kind of diabolical environmental disaster is disingenuous for the record i love your suggestions in terms of anti consumerism and a more general environmentalism but we talking about climate change in particular here i not sure if your focus on buying less new stuff is the panacea for climate change you portraying it as which is why i be interested in some numbers to back it up
not an option in my part of texas i life with family in suburb job is miles away by car no bike paths or even sidewalks whole way up so you would have to take an hour ride each way minimum change and no showers outside of home closer apartments to there are a month for a one bed or of a monthly paycheck that mile ride is also a minute drive by car there is no public transport at all so the county is outside of harris so it hard to move without changing jobs and moving your options here are drive walk bike in weather and it might be pouring rain we are a subtropical climate after all or take uber but that out of your shift paycheck
warning this video is meant to inspire change and action some scenes depicted may cause anxiety or be otherwise disturbing my intention and hope is to leave the watcher feeling equal parts upset and empowered because we know how to fix this we have the solutions my goal is to change the narrative surrounding climate change from one of division to one of unity from opposites factions yelling at eachother lobbing insults from the fortress ramparts we have constructed on this topic distractedly nitpicking minor details and instead we can move towards unification by focusing the discussion on the things we can all agree on to do this we must listen to eachother we must value eachother and our opinions we must value and hold the standard of true and honest science and mostly we must seek to find and work towards a common goal we do need to agree on the motivation why we choose to take action as long as we all agree on where that action takes us we can all agree and unify behind the benefit of humans living sustainably on a fertile and healthy planet to get there we must fight against the disconnection from nature which the past years has created we must re integrate ourselves into nature and work towards that on a daily basis because when ecosystems somewhere else are destroyed we are complacent but when the river that feeds the soils that feeds our children are damaged we fight to the death and now is the time for fighting to the death not only because we need nature more than it needs us but because we are nature
in my opinion the primary differences between ideology and theology are the degree of idolization do the leaders of your movement have a cult of personality built arround them and the personification of the ideal are the ideals of the group treated as entities rather than concepts ex climate change and mother nature the state has the advantage of very easily being able to fit both of these categories if it gets you to obsess with them meaning being anti religion is a logical step to consolidate power
toews is an adult eligible to vote and has the same right to free speech and expression as any other canadian citizen currently residing in the united states just because he plays sports does take away that right he not stopping in the middle of the game to talk about climate change it an off ice pr interview
ditching your car saves as much per seat as three people going vegan for a year and a round trip long haul flight adds as much back into the atmosphere per seat as two people going vegan for a year will remove from it people should go vegan because it morally the right thing to do but they should also stay conscious of the fact that it just one of many steps to controlling climate change and should be used as a reason to ignore these larger contributors that should also lead to lifestyle changes
how is the us a theocracy um have you paid attention to how many us politicians use evangelical christianity as a way to stop abortions marriage equality news interracial news made by history discriminating in the name of religion segregationists and slaveholders did it somehow improving the environment and reducing posteverything why dont christian conservatives worry about climate change
i live in the uk and i not heard this notion that kale and oranges would taste different in hawaii compared to northern canada or at a farmers market either i bought fruit and veg st the supermarket the surplus store and home grown and to me they all taste equally good and our climate is nothing like hawaii it strikes me as more likely that it is largely a matter of tastebuds changing you mention kale being bitter it is but it something that i have gotten to like more the more i eat it and the meals you describe as bland like lentils and potatoes and carrots i would also happily eat those and consider them tasty even without oil or salt a lot of people find when they make this change they are surprised at how much their palate adapts to it after a while and things that previously did appeal become tasty this change might be all you need it true that it will be difficult at first but if you really want to do it it will get easier
not afraid of it but the fact that it makes no mention of a carbon tax fee makes me much less interested in it we should have been talking this much about the carbon fee and dividend proposed last year we still should united states carbon fee and dividend bipartisan progress towards a climate change
well then that was my mistake for assuming you were a supporter of the republican party and i apologize for that i agree with what you saying about both parties are terrible and only have their own agendas however one specific party is purposely encouraging their supporters to deny facts to push their own agenda the biggest problems we are facing right now are covid and climate change and unfortunately only one party is giving that any kind of attention and i did get the joke by the way lol i do like biden and i frankly sick of both parties trying to elect the oldest people they can possibly find anyways i think we agree on a lot of stuff sorry for getting heated and being accusatory i think our entire country is under an unhealthy amount of stress right now not an excuse just an explanation
climate change is not man made and had been happening for literally thousands of years
by making those companies richer it supposed to be done in a controlled manner not in a way that leaves of people unable to use alternatives this is about climate change and if you believe that you wilfully ignorant
for the most part those of us in stem actually cringe when we see people like greta thunberg being shoehorned in as the new poster children the people who praise greta are largely outside of stem and do realise how harmful her inappropriate behaviour and juvenile approach actually is her behaviour completely undermines any progress we made towards educating society on this topic and getting people to take it seriously nobody wants to listen to a hysterical teenager insulting and screaming at some of the most powerful people in the world i feel bad for her because she clearly a child with a lot of issues and her parents forced her to become the poster child for environmental issues and saving the world when she should been enjoying her youth her speech was not inspiring it was highly inappropriate it is an honour to speak before the members of the un and she screamed at them like a brat the entire time it was absolutely appalling nothing she has put forth is new or groundbreaking you can find all of her information about climate change on the internet she has even completed high school yet she is not in the position to lecture anyone on this topic the adults around her exploited this child with autism and wrongly thrust her into the spotlight they have instilled a disproportionate amount of fear into her to the point where she is frequently in hysterics over this issue she is not emotionally capable of handling this responsibility nor should she be expected to be it all incredibly disturbing to see
wow this article is biased at all global warming is a poor name for climate change there nothing we can do about it if you have any common sense this planet has been here for billion years and the first billion or so it was covered with volcanoes and the atmosphere was filled with gases that we so concerned with today a human influence with only years of releasing greenhouse gases into the earth atmosphere is almost preposterous to believe it has a profound effect on our planet sure the climate is changing in areas around the planet but this planet is fine just all another big scheme for big companies to get money i thought reddit was big on seeing schemes like these companies out to get money but they only see the republican ones and get so blinded by political view that they do understand that they are the reason why this nation is falling apart way off topic now but hopefully you all get my point and actually read it and do shout blasphemy at me when if all you do is look at the sheer numbers years out of billion and say we really fucking up this planet that badly and need to invest billions of dollars trying to fix something that not even broken then we should all just succumb to the end of humanity anyway because our species fucked up this planet far too quickly
he was specifically criticizing the climate change video do nt have the link but it was badempanada channel you can go through the comments of that video and see the awful kurtz replies to the video but on that note kurtz has misleading videos only on controversial topics that are related to his sponsors i noticed this when i saw the gmo video that had the same style of misinformation cherry picking overemphasis of minimal evidence in favor of narrative etc that the one about climate you can clearly see the difference from his other videos because there a clear message of what you should think about a highly controversial topic that no sane person would resolve in a animated video unsurprisingly that message is always in line with the sponsors
i think you would have to go back pretty far back into history to find a textbook that claims indians are savages and blacks are only fit to be chattel i doubt even your grandparents were taught that in school these ideas are still presented but as something we used to believe as historical fact they not dead and buried the moral complexities of ideas such as manifest destiny and american exceptionalism are hard to talk about even today textbooks tend to mention these ideas and hurry on to the next subject this is by plan not accident my point was that there are ways of handling difficult ideas glossing over facts is a very simple one the author of this text decided to directly challenge the notion that climate change is man made with a falsehood and that is what is exceptionally dubious about the current text my memory about george washington having never told a lie is that it was not taught from a text i do recall from where this was learned essentially we say that everything we learned when we were young was taught to us but we really do recall where we learned things so those searches are as convincing as you would like if you really want to convince me of this issue track down a school text from the last years that states washington never cut down a cherry tree i add that gw chopping down a tree does show the same kind of issue as manifest destiny there is no aspect in which it is a political football it may be false but it not controversial
i do think it matters the entire world was unprepared for this sars hit when bush was in office and we got lucky because it died out before it got a foothold here but bush did nothing to improve the government response then in which killed americans obama did nothing to improve the system and prepare then we had the brief ebola scare in again obama did nothing to beef up america response to such threats to public health the cdc also has been a complete joke last year they put out a report that the biggest threat to human life was climate change the world health organization is also a joke that organization helped china downplay the threat they claimed did not transmit person to person and that the threat was low our entire government and most governments around the world was totally caught off guard elections would nt have changed anything a viral outbreak being a threat to the country was not on the radar of any politician of any party anywhere
it funny when i googled global warming it gave a definition global warming is the unusually rapid increase in earth average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels and when i googled climate change it resulted in a headline that said global warming i assumed they were interchangeable terms but am i wrong
environment economy who gives a fuck about industries and business if there is no world to live in you conservatives a nuts if you do think climate change is the most important issue
i do think the warning is the issue at least not the biggest issue we see storm warnings and climate change warnings and stock market warnings all the time that do immediately result in panicked responses people recognize it as a serious alert and act accordingly when necessary the breakdown seems to come in the order in which information is presented and the way it is formatted warning malfunction test shattered windows it starts out putting people on alert handing them a word quoted in a way so as suggest a more sinister meaning than usual let them know where the danger is coming from and the damage to expect as a result the could is hiding in there in the perfect spot for a reader to glaze over after they primed themselves to expect terrible news then the article clarifies a less deadly possibility and now you have a perfect recipe for people who do read closely to feel they been pulled in by fake news someone who goes back and rereads the headline more carefully will realize their error but the disappointment is already there
so should they want to see climate change gets catastrophic to ensure job security
bahaha what climate change are they referring too the fake one that push an anti capitalist anti western ideology or the slowly changing natural cycle of the earth that we have absolutely no control over
hard science post apocalyptic stories where the event was war disease or zombies but climate change day after tomorrow was pretty soft and was absurd the nutrinos are mutating but there have been one or two indie flicks that deal with the drought and famine which would result i basing as much of the details of the cataclysm on actual climate science
scientist clearly anyone that can use google can become an expert in any field of science so why do they have to listen to those egg heads new and wonderful sciences have emerged from these people who are so not complete fuckwits climate change denial anti evolution neo epidemiology and flat earth theory are all on the rise while actual science is mocked as a priesthood of nerds who are just pushing an agenda
advice coming from somebody who most likely sat in their car for an hour to finally pull up to a complete stranger rolled your window down so u can stick your arm out and get jabbed by a concoction of experimental sludge that is now killing off the population less people less climate change
ya just read your posting history you are a climate change denying bootlicker that pretends he knows something about how viruses mutate but is actually as ignorant as the horse paste eaters are if you want me to further back in your idiocy piss me off again bootlicker
yeah and manbearpig was almost ten years ago what an idiot al gore was to think climate change was real south park has always been fundamentally reactionary those pushing for change are wrong no matter what change they push for nothing is a bigger crime to matt and trey than giving a shit their ideology is apathetic libertarian whether you on the left or the right if you asking me to change my behavior you suck as it stands the political left tends to push for more change than the political right does as it stands matt and trey admit they dislike conservatives and really fucking hate liberals it is about left or right it about change versus comfort if you trying to change something they think you annoying and they think you lame because caring about stuff is lame it the same attitude that establishes u mad and butthurt as the ultimate trump cards in internet arguments caring is for losers and if you become personally invested in politics you part of the problem uncritical detached acceptance of the status quo is the only morally upright posture and those who draw a distinction between is and ought are all smug bullies outlandish freaks closed minded zealots it a show that teaches its audience to become lazy and self satisfied that praises them for being uncritically accepting of their own biases and that provides them with an endless buffet of thought terminating cliches suitable for shutting down all manner of challenges to their comfort zones south park is a place where you never have to have your assumptions challenged it a place where you always right you should bother to think and the people asking you to change your mind are annoying busybodies and prigs who should just shut up and leave you alone south park is if you excuse the expression a safe space
hope this assbite has kids when they perish from the effects of climate change he can reminisce on all he did to bring it on sooner
the things is that if you fellas are wrong there will be serious consequences if the otherside is wrong we just get general positives such as cleaner energy younger people tend to get more emotional about this because pretty much all the scientific community believe that climate change is real why would they ban people who might hinder there cause in trying improve the world there kids will one day inhabit
of course they will and they always do them the global temperature will rise global warming all ice caps will be melted oceans will rise shorelines will flood cue al gore buying up properties on shorelines us temperatures are dropping globally the ice at the poles is growing them the global temperatures will drop global dimming new ice ages could happen freak ice storms the ice at the caps does matter because it not the right kind of ice us ipcc got caught admitting to doctoring all of their numbers global temperatures have changed in a decade them climate change do argue with of scientists all from the ipcc settled science mahem hurricanes tornadoes the world ends this year us literally nothing you said has come true all of our predictions for the past years have them settled science denier settled science it fun being old enough to remember all of this first hand
i do think the correct way to stop people spouting ideas that are distasteful or illogical is to stop them from speaking it to refute them with something like climate change it just requires time and effort because in the end they factually wrong why is it that you see gaming sites as the home to this debate is there you know an entire internet where this debate is taking place what i not sure of is why you so against curation involving some level of conclusions i know that global warming is real if i running a news site why should i give airtime to someone who says it is should i also give airtime to someone who says lizardmen are real i think this might be the fundamental point here why is kotaku supposed to be a home to debate what is going on here they never done that in the past was there more backlash against that article than that video of that black dude who found it offensive that they were generalizing no but lots of people supported the ideas in that video i think they need to be more open on offering their platform to experts to discuss more in depth issues like that rather than the current state where it bloggers who not really qualified to do it experts like anita sarkeesian does anyone have the credentials that anita has and a willingness to produce content for kotaku did they do it because they thought they were worthy or because they espouse a political viewpoint they agree with i really want to get at this point this is a hard line would they post someone they thought to be completely batshit of course not we should expect them to they ought to curate you ought expect kotaku to sit back and go well some people say feminism is important and some people say it is if they are really convinced that it is important i do agree with you that they should promote extreme or fringe viewpoints but that not what is going on here this simply is a reasonable or healthy expectation and you do really hold it when it comes to anything else they write
climate change
come back when you ready to act like an adult edit thanks for deleting the name calling abuse what i getting at is that only a few serious large scale accidents have occurred chernobyl fukushima kyshtym windscale then you got serious incidents like and chalk river which could have killed people but did overall these kinds of incidents at nuclear power plants are very rare and most incidents occurred in the and when safety standards were lower and technology was less understood whereas modern safety protocols and newer reactors are much safer with fukushima in particular the evacuation caused deaths compared to from the accident itself albeit fukushima did contaminate a large area when compared with the global effects of burning fossil fuels ie raising the global temperature altering the climate melting ice sheets causing the mass extinction of animals and acidification of the oceans nuclear power is much more environmentally friendly one day hopefully all of our power can be renewable and green until then if we going to take human caused climate change seriously nuclear needs to play a part deaths per gwh why would that not be a valid measure provided we include things like deaths that occurred during sourcing of the raw materials coal uranium rare earths for solar wind
well i argue that him winning the election was the beginning did anyone think all of a sudden he was going to make climate change a priority of any kind
i agree the problem is people supporting climate change are so intent on convincing people that they start to exaggerate when they do that people denying it can point to inconsistency and say see you guys do even agree why should i believe you
optimism is the only discussion needed in this battle the more people like the guy i replied to create excuses more people will just have in their mind that nothing they can do will help and it does matter anymore so just it all the actual reality is that the only way we get the nations you talking about to do anything the only way we getting to tackle climate change is by being optimistic and reminding not just ourselves but the people around us that we can in fact prevent a vast amount of destruction and suffering and even reverse and rebuild our planet
trump is a source of incredible evil he withdrew from the paris climate accord he has repealed regulations protecting our air and water he has pronounced that climate change is a hoax trump is destroying the environment and the earth

are you really comparing climate change denial to religion
kind of hilarious how the gop privatized texas power grid in order to reap profits for a few refused to implement cold weather regulations after the storms and are now blaming renewable energy for the problems as if the wind turbines are one of the few things still working not to mention they get about of their power from coal or natural same stations fucking out over extreme weather then there the worsening polar vortex because of change definitions what is the polar unpredictable i sure but anyway not excusing eskom zuma gupta corruption just funny how greedy fucks always screw things over for citizens whether it public or private energy
when it turns out half of miami is structurally unsound because of climate change we all going to be paying for a lot of rich folks to keep their wealth
provided climate change does screw with the gulf stream too much in the next century
why ca he be like the rest of the politicians they believe in it but are too corrupt to take climate change action yeah that would make a difference
if you looking for a christian perspective i believe you may wish to look at contact katharine radio tapestry sharing how to talk climate change with evangelical as she does a great deal of work in that area and may be able to help best of luck on your paper
well they are ridiculing the deniers not climate change
thanks to corporate investors sucking up large tracts of homes to rent out and stimulus money flooding the parasite class housing is now one of the largest ponzi schemes in canadian history so everyone is trying to benefit from a rising market by hoping to not be the last greater fool to buy into it besides while sea level rise from climate change is now pretty much baked into the pie thwaites glacier natch it will still take years before places like richmond start seeing the effects of high sea levels with respect to storm surges and such some people are ignorant others even intentionally so but most simply think that they can do their shit and get out of richmond before they left holding the bag in knee deep seawater
it called change the name of your movement to something that ca be proven wrong each time the previous name is proven wrong nope wo work climate change checkmate you ca prove that climates do change
personally global warming is an issue more serious to me than the economy of a country that may not have humans on it within the next years if nothing is done about climate change thank you for highlighting why the general public feels it can ignore people claiming that climate change is real if you do know what the fuck you are talking about shut up you are hurting the creditability of the people that know what they are talking about
deal me in this is why imwithher is so fundamental america is facing the most dangerous the most extreme frankly too extreme to be taking seriously threat that it ever has donald trump is a fascist national socialist theocrat with a racist homophobic transphobic ect ect agenda that will hurt everyone who is not a straight white christian male how extreme is the donald trump threat consider the following donald trump has refused to release his tax returns donald trump has bankrupted more companies than he has children donald trump family original name is actually drumpf his extremest agenda is so extreme it will take social issues back to what is the deal with his tax returns it will allow us to see that drumpf is actually not rich or wealthy at all we would have indisputable evidence of his net worth and we will see that not only does he not pay taxes at all but he is also likely broke how he runs his campaign ect is another indication i interviewed the field director of tax law at block about the matter i asked him why does drumpf just release his tax returns once and for all he responded simply because he to extreme to be taking seriously and his tax returns would reveal that later as we were driving on interstate with the wind cruising through our hair and tokking up to some dank weed he explained further drumpf tax returns are the holy grail i guarantee you that it would prove that he is lying about everything it will show us his net worth and it likely near he does donate to charity and he does pay taxes i know this because i in the industry and i get it i ca go out and make this public but trust me it true so why is drumpf so untrustworthy this is why imwithher is so valuable it provides answers i asked about the ancestry and the genealogy of drumpf what is the significance of it i went to the head of genealogy at usc to ask the question posed is drumpf an indication of extremest attitudes she replied absolutely as we called for the elevator she continued there nothing wrong with the drumpf name per se but it an indication of dishonesty trump supporters you need to ask yourself why did he lie about this what is he hiding perhaps he is a felon a white collar criminal or perhaps he is a peddafile why else would he be so dishonest hell look at the tax return issues i brought her up to speed on the tax return issues after speaking with the field director at block i knew it this is why imwithher is so important we gotten to the bottom of his tax returns and we will keep uncovering issues and exposing drumpf for the lying fraud he is this is empowering we are destroying the male intittlement behind his actions and we are finally for the first time holding the top white wealthy men accountable this ties in directly with the bankruptcies let look at it logically drumpf is a businessman drumpf has dozens of bankruptcies on his record drumpf has not repaid millions if not billions of dollars in loans as a result of the bankruptcies extreme much absolutely i wrote an essay in my embodiments of patriarchy class on this very subject it not enough that drumpf is an oppressive force a testament to the white male patriarchy he had to flaunt it with his bankruptcies he stole money from working people and did return it this is a femminnest issue because these actions affected women disproportionately and yes i got an a for the paper so where are we with this we exposed the damages of his bankruptcies and his extremest attitudes his hatred of minorities especially mexicans and blacks as well as poor people and frankly anyone who is a cis white straight male is what makes him the most extreme what could we expect from a drumpf precedency deportation of mexicans deportation and incarceration of blacks expansion of bluelivesmatter and dissolution of blacklivesmatter divisive attitudes climate change that will affect the world a decrease in science and education the last part is key republicans absolutely hate education they know an educated people will never vote against there self interests they know educated people get it and vote for candidates that offer them the most this is why he would cut it here some more more wealth division tax breaks for the rich tax increases for the poor regressive taxes private prisons training camps and halocaust style society so where does this leave us you have to ask us what kind of person would vote for drumpf here are some defining attributes do care about black people do care about minorities do care he lied about drumpf do care about climate change do care about gay and trans rights do care about bankruptcies do care about wealth division do want to redistribute wealth from the top to the bottom votes against his own self interests i personally do know anyone who matches that criteria but then again i do know anyone voting for drumpf i asked the southern poverty law center voter rights division about these characteristics i asked via email are these the characteristics of a drumpf voter they answered absolutely yes drumpf is extreme that the bottom line and the people that support him are fringe alt right fanatics who are to extreme to be taking seriously they want to take america back to to prevent equality unless you are a white straight cis male ect ect so who votes for drumpf very few people actually there no way he could have won the election without some sort of fraud but is voter fraud a concern yes absolutely republicans are epic at voter fraud when drumpf won this is how we did it so that so how do we stop this the power is in the top who need there wealth the least this is why the power distribution and wealth distribution is such a problem do they need there money well no but that does matter they still steal money from the working poor who need it the most such as drumpf drumpf would pay his workers he routinely stiffs people and fires them what can be done this is why imwithher is such an important phenomena hillary clinton is the only one that can solve the issue and that is why we need to support her the email continues if you care about black people minorities and women care about drumpf lying care about climate change care about gay and trans rights care about drumpf and his bankruptcies want a basic income want wealth redistribution ect ect ect then the only choice is to really join the imwithher movement support a team that is looking out for the common good for the who neeed help from the government the most for the minorities and gay trans people who need there defense the most ect ect i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this if you have any questions or concerns
you should read their biology textbooks which deny evolution and dinosaurs or their earth science textbooks which say the earth is years old and climate change does exist tldr all books are the bible in mississippi
if it makes you feel good think about this humans are the most invasive species produced by nature we are not artificial or out of this world our time to invade and destroy species has come pretty logically and also equally logically has come our abuse of nature to the extent that we are destroying the climate and parts of the foodchain that let us survive in a couple of centuries we will have such a bad situation that only a small percentage of our population will survive while the rest of us will be wiped out unless we change things dramatically nature on this planet which has seen superdeserts when all the continents were one then evolved massive amounts of humongous life the long age of dinosaurs when both plants and animals grew to enormous sizes if nature could could go from a global superdesert to that we are negligible nature will find a way around plastic but it will take a good few of years for the entire foodchain to be able to digest plastic humans will be long gone nature will bounce back it always does i feel your pain you know but nature always reclaims the planet in the ultimate revenge against all kinds of invasive species in the grand scheme of things we are a short lived anomaly that is unless we go about fixing the plastic problem and the climate problem edit source for superdesert
label gmos and put a moratorium on gmos and pesticides until they are proven safe it a naive platform for sure gmos are perfectly safe have been for a long time thousands of years actually seedless watermelon are gmos in the sense they were selectively bred to yield a watermelon without seeds still not going to kill you we most certainly should be commited to reversing climate change but we have to be smart about it if it partially destroys economic welfare in the process we will lose progress in the chaos and may not gain it back in a reasonable amount of time climate change is not something we can keep putting off it will happen in the negative sense in its own time if we do nothing
there are plenty of things we can do to help the environment in small amounts but as most experts agre animal agriculture mainly beef and other large animals is the biggest cause of deforestation and habitat destruction and land use large contribution to ocean deadzones like in mexico eating a meat free meal is low on energy consumption water consumption gas emissions not only it being proven a thousands of times that eating these meats directly lead to various cancers cancer prevention diet exercise nutrition diet fruit vegetables meat and and all meats strongly linked to diabetes heart disease stroke and other atherosclerosis related diseases heart disease being our as many already know and on top of that the extremely cruel conditions these poor innocent creatures are raised in make it obvious it is a habit i needed to and we all need to just quit if literally everytime i picked up my phone i knew i killed something increased my risk of the most deadly diseases and help to fund or contribute to one of the leading causes of deforestation species extinction land use and ocean deadzones i would definitely start drastically cutting back on screen time not to mention many of these things are extremely useful to us when meat is literally just for pleasure sake but maybe i being quick to assume all people know all these things
this right here is the truth everyone please join the citizen climate there are local branches all throughout the country which will email you with ways to help in your community easy links to write to your reps in congress and more seriously everyone needs to get involved and here is a direct link to writing write your about upcoming legislation try to change the wording a bit so it does get lumped in as a bot
so they feel that democrats have no useful insights or contributions regarding climate change wtf
comment content punitive actions are clearly spelled out in the paris agreement mostly economic sanctions iirc it up to the individual states to follow up on them which will certainly be a test but most of the countries involved are serious enough about the issue that i think they follow through in this case subreddit politics submission title trump will definitely pull out of paris climate change deal redditor polezo comment permalink
the issue here is that climate change has become a politically divisive issue once upon a time there existed consensus the first major meeting about climate change in rio on the showed there was world wide consensus over the decades that consensus has broken down now instead of acting we get bogged down into debating the nitty gritty and drag our feet collectively instead of doing anything
eu is more important for me than my own country lol if people vote corrupt thieves in the parliament then they should be kicked out eu is the only thing that stands against us china and russia and who is trying to build a better future for fighting against climate change
chim does give some kind of power we see vivec using it to bind azura to put a spear in her mouth before banishing her in the trial of vivec and that after the heart of lorkhan has been sent away i personally interpreted the power chim gives you as allowing you do whatever you want but only if you really want it purely because of yourself in ther sermons vivec talks a lot about acting according to one own nature and he a pretty hedonistic chap talos too actually what with betraying his former emperor and allies as hjalti early beard and he also the only other chimster we know i intepret being able to achieve chim being able to ignore the evidence that you do exist as a sign of incredible self centeredness which fits both vivec and talos and if chim is the deep awareness that the world is a dream and thus becoming some kind of lucid dreamer it probably easiest to change the dream according to your deep desires rather than for any noble goals so vivec was incapable of stopping dagoth ur with chim because he did want it enough because it was for his people and not himself but is perfectly capable of using it against azura because it solely for his own vengeance and talos changed cyrodiil climate not for his legions but because he personally hated the jungle and preferred high rock climate that how i see it anyway
it does really work like that the eu is going to suddenly fight twice as much climate change to make up for trump idiocy
bernie considers climate crisis the most valuable change to national security he opposed the building of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a huge influence on the climate bernie bot
predictions of famine have turned out to be wrong at least so far in reality technology and food production have been able to keep pace with population growth yes but at what cost as per my original contention we destroying our genetic heritage losing species and ecosystems alarmingly humans may not go extinct but we ca technology our way out of losing and already having lost masses of species whether predictions of a dramatic contraction of the human population come to be or not does really matter perhaps we manage to plateau the human population somehow perhaps not but what for certain is we ca sustain population growth indefinitely even with all our wonderful technology there is no reason to expect or evidence to suggest that our competition for resources will pan out any differently to bacteria competing for nutrients on an agar plate population wise the planet is rapidly progressing towards a barren inhospitable place as we lose ecosystems and species no doubt climate change is real and due to human activity but so what the climate is relatively easy to mitigate with technology as i said some places will become less habitable or inhabitable some will become more habitable climate per se is not the issue so to be clear what i am saying is this i care about the climate change or rather the planet from an ecological but not an anthropocentric perspective the climate has changed due to human activity and will change again humans are a scourge and at this point the fewer we make and the more we get rid of the better especially those who have shown themselves to be unworthy yes in my eyes there is going to be intense competition for resources in the not too distant future exacerbated by climate change people will be displaced there will be wars there will be slaughter my comment about the middle east and the whole of africa was gratuitous and gratuitously controversial sure but you know what if it comes down to superstitious medieval murderous islamists or me and mine in the technologically and socially advanced west there is no competition ditto murderous superstitious and ignorant hordes of africans if you look at the competition to date these people largely through their own lack have lost this is the backlash against globalism there will be competition and dire outcomes so why the fuck would i give these undeserving people a leg up at the expense of my people fuck that the people in these backwards places need to come to terms with the consequences of their own behaviours willful ignorance and geo political realities and realise that if they populate to an extent greater than their technology wealth and societies can support then they ca come crying to the west for haven and a new start because human suffering that results from conflict war famine disease pestilence etc is a real tragedy and you would probably appreciate this more acutely if you were experiencing it first hand it a personal tragedy and i do need to experience it first hand to understand that but as you gathered by now it not a global tragedy it a global imperative
no he arguing that there can be cases where the other side is worthy of taking seriously and supplements it with extreme outlying examples my point was even within those extreme examples there still some wiggle room because if you dismiss these ideas you never understand the problems with the people embracing those ideas and then when you apply his mindset to further things you start getting scenarios like trump rejecting vs embracing rather than a public dialogue no matter how wrong the idea is it does mean you should dismiss the fact that for other people it right otherwise you kill all hopes of having a conversation daryl davis is a great example and an incredible story black man who befriended kkk leading clansman you can disagree with an idea but you should still equally try to understand it and respect their right to think like flat earthers sure we can just label it stupid and brush it to the side but why is no one asking why do these people have such a need to oppose and go against science because that to me seems the real root with things like climate change and anti vax also happening but you can seldom talk about these things anymore because we censor ourselves by deeming topics wrong or not worthy all too fast these days
organizations seem to be changing their message based on that lack of action from the submitted article but climate change happens gradually and we already gone up almost degree centigrade and seen eight inches of ocean rise barring unthinkably radical change we hit degrees in thirty or forty years and that been described as a catastrophe melting ice rising waters drought famine and massive economic turmoil and many scientists now think we on track to or degrees even shell oil said that it anticipates a world degrees hotter because it does see governments taking the steps now that are consistent with the degrees c scenario that would mean a world racked by economic and social and environmental collapse so even shell oil says that old predictions of degree rise is outdated because we have done enough
first of all you been brainwashed by youtube just because someone takes a snippet of one of ben shaprio lectures when a student asks him a question and he replies and they have a small back and forth it does make it a debate not everything is a debate sometimes people talk and disagree on this stop watching youtube if you want to know these people it a good place to start for example jordan peterson has tens of thousands of hours of content but if you want to know them intellectually actually go to their talks actually read their books and even try and email them with some questions you have you see in these debates these intellectuals are debating fucking moronic dogs they picked up off the street to deliver their typical tirades who are these moronic dogs really weird way to insult people seems like you mad at something i do know what i can only assume you disagree with a lot of jordan peterson and ben shaprio say so you trying to dismiss their intellect by calling the people they debate moronic never heard anyone use the term moronic dogs before how women are basically slaves in the west no one said this if they did please quote it also if they did say this they definitively have some reason behind it do take small sentances out of context post the full few paragraphs of speech that was said read it through make sure you understand it then comment on it i doubt you did you just heard that got mad and ran to reddit to make a hate thread debators i never heard jordan peterson or ben shapiro refer to themselves as a debator they both have much bigger things going on than debating people rip these retards apart with facts and logic yes here it is you judging their intellect based off of a youtube video do get mad at them because people take snippets from their channel and make titles like ben shario kills liberal with hard facts because it clickbait it how youtube works in order for that person to get the most views if you get tilted by a title of a video and the contents of that video then i do think the debating space is for you since a lot of different opinions are shared you do seem capable of handling differing opinions they gain a following that sucks their dick and believes every word that they say this is true some people agree with of what ben says and disagree with the other some may agree with of what he says because that their genuine belief system and they think and were brought up like ben i say there are some out there who do mindlessly follow certain people but the same goes for all e celebs and influencers it just how some people act i have no doubt in mind there someone you follow mindlessly and no matter how much they get beat in a debate you still take their side but when it comes time to actually debate things that matter like the economy racial tension global warming and a number of other much more important topics they fall apart and start making up the most retarded arguments how exactly do they fall apart in their defence they do claim to know about everything and every problem ever created ever i have no doubt in mind ben and others struggle to answer questions on certain topics because it just not where the specialise i did know because these people were public figures they had to know about everything ben shapiro and jordan peterson have both publicly denounced their beliefs in climate change not true for jordan peterson as i watched his talk at oxford union i ca speak for ben as i do know climate change is a tricky topic have made numerous racist and outrageous statements jordan peterson and ben shaprio are racist not from their numerous talks i seen from that statement alone i somewhat feel like i know where you stand politically and let just say it further left than a moderate leftist and are in general kinda fucking stupid just because someone has a different belief than you based on the facts they gathered it does make them stupid i have no doubt in my mind they smarter than you and i do say that someone who a fan of these people i say that as someone who sees an angry person who just mad that people with different views have a following
capital is available if it the project economics work and the scale of the project is not ridiculous that the scale of big infrastructure if we just give up because private capital is interested we going to dig a much bigger hole climate change wise and are very likely to not be able to get ourselves out we are consuming about as much energy as received to the earth by the sun so renewables will simply never be enough unless you go to outer space the easy hydro renewables sites are good start but that has scratched the surface and of replacing fossil fuel use you going to have to pick a direction here either you really worried about the task at hand being so large thus we should start now no matter the preferences of private capital or you not too worried and you rather wait for a technological fix to come around ultimately i agree that wind solar wo be enough though it might be closer in canada then most places thanks to our ridiculous hydro resources that part of why i support nuclear and am reasonably excited about the possibilities for the imsr this does mean we should be building now though every year those coal plants keep running adds a lot of and when the technological fix comes around we not going to be able to implement it all in a year there will likely be a fairly prolonged deployment
this climate change will tank the economy at this point it simply a question of just how bad it will get
why is it up to the usa to pay for the rest of the world problems the usa is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than most other countries many of which are not rich developed western ones that will bear the brunt of climate change their contribution to climate change is disproportionate to the rest of the world trump did not withdraw from it because of legitimate concerns about how it works he withdrew from it because he a scientifically illiterate moron who does care about the environment and because he on the side of big business
some someone in say he has reasonable views on climate change i what
it is definetly not cheap clean well that depends how you define it it is much better than coal my biggest issue with nuclear is that it is not scalable we can not run the world on nuclear because there is ltierally not enough fuel for that heck we can not even stop climate change with it because building reactors takes too long so stop pushing for a dead technology
your mythical crazy coal climate change deniers do exist outside of like whack jobs on facebook dude your prime minister and most of your government begs to differ if you ca see that then maybe you the one who should pull his fucking head out it would indeed be hard to see what happening around you otherwise based on your response i gon na assume you are one of those short sighted economic liberals who trust the almighty free market to save the day especially since you been going around reddit calling people far left fuckers which by the way does exactly make you look smart anyway we see where these ideals bring you fyi you ca eat cash you ca drink cash and you ca replace a deserted burnt land with cash
if i not mistaken a big issue with extinction rebellion and sunrise movement is that they backed away from their explicit degrowth foundation solving the issue of climate change and human destruction of the natural world has to start with broad economic changes unfortunately anticapitalism continues to be unpopular but you right we ca just do nothing
i am a huge environmentalist and unfortunately climate change is being used by democrats in a way that will ultimately do more damage than good i have heard more and more that we must get rid of the two party system by making dc and puerto rico states to ensure democrats have control for more than years in order to save the world from climate change
anti climate change people will take that as a challenge to pollute more
ton would almost certainly solve climate change over time at least as it would make dispatchable solar storage cheaper than ccgt power plants further as you pointed out it would permanently increase gas prices which would accelerate the shift to electric vehicles together that something like three quarter of carbon emissions but really the main point is that it would make disparchable solar cheaper than baseload gas it would not result in much of a decrease in consumption of energy services but it would shift how we get the services
it is rather well known that the gop is anti science and give more weight to feelings rather that facts see evolution and climate change as obvious examples see also abstinence only sex education the democratic party has no problem with gmo or nuclear both sides are the same is a meme because only one side uses it and because it requires fallacies whataboutism and false equivalence for a better understanding of the republican base and there association with science see below the best stance is to accept it explain why it is best to rely on non science do deny everyone knows you are being honest simply denying and with false claims is a sign of weakness why are you defending from weakness
one country moves forward another one moves backward another country moves forward then move backward i ca believe overpopulation is a talked about issue in this climate change world women need reproductive freedom and access to birth control in this day and age if they want it
thanks for sharing one of them was a corporate at services australia i feel that part is being talked about enough i feel sorry for the dumb kids getting sucked into it the openly nazi guys i have no sympathy for but i have no idea what to do about them without initially meeting their force with the same this is from a non violent guy who read the royal commissions into both the nsw and vic police and highlighted the systemic corruption issues damn i hate being a civilian in the middle of this i have to say the asio guy at could go a bit further to mention that a few of the little tools might be under the impression that there a systemic collapse coming because the government he works for is doing sweet f a about the climate i swiftly affirm though that having a freaking race war about it is going to help does it not occur to anyone that climate change is our biggest threat and that the entire human race can not solve it unless we all work together i suppose not in this group this is going to get more complicated before it gets simpler
australia first female prime minister said years ago on climate the science is settled she did last long and her left wing party has been out of power since even loosing the last election fought on climate change
hi xenocidecp thank you for participating in politics however your submission has been removed for the following reason please do not flood the submission r politics wiki you have already submitted articles within the last hours these links are pence stance on climate these portraits show exuberant donald trump climate change is turning into a race between politics and creator of bad lip reading videos says election has defied russia may be wounded but it can still i a bot and sometimes i make mistakes if you feel this removal was in error please message the message i have a question about the queue flooding rules
what i find interesting horrifying is that inevitable turn towards fascism and how rather than actually doing anything productive to address the situation it most likely accelerate it we already staring down the barrel of it in america when prices start rising even more they turn to strong men characters who will tell them they turn everything back to the way it was and persecute the real villains insert group here the thing is that they wo target the actual causes of the deficit and since fascists usually have to bribe the fuck out of corporate interests they most likely accelerate shortages due to ecological damage and climate change fascist regimes also rely on investing a ton of resources into control of their citizenry which eats up more resources that could be used towards mitigating collapse and it almost turns into a positive feedback loop of resource waste and oppression until it inevitably implodes but this is just an american problem i been looking at the rise of chinese imperialism combined with india rise in authoritarianism and pakistan instability and it seems like a powder keg waiting to go off india and china both get a lot of water from the himalayas and the mountainous glaciers in that area of which pakistan is home to a lot of but increasing temps and aridification are decreasing glacier melt yields and both china and india are rapidly trying to industrialize to the west standard of living and need resources to do so but those traditional resources are running low if china and india start fighting over the himalayas or india starts a war with pakistan over their water rights it could quickly escalate because all three are nuclear powers add into that pakistan current economic problems and it is looking great i agree that the world is on a steady downward spiral and it the reason i got myself a vasectomy before i had any kids i not trying to re enact the road and i do want to bring any children into a world i know for a fact will be shittier than the one i was given
if climate change kills all the grass he have to find a new job
some days i would agree with you especially since climate change and pollution might just kill us all horribly anyway no matter what we do however rich people are nothing without people who play along in their games sure there have been large successes in history over capital and rich people in general but that does mean there can not be as soon as the exploited resign the exploiters win it unjust that the exploited need to carry all the burdens but that all the more reason to tear down the system would you say
montana is actually projected to get hit pretty severely people seem to think that moving north will allow them to escape from climate change but it wo the entire planet is changing and with the changes come catastrophic events no matter where you are la is actually projected to have some of the more mild consequences
this is like saying wanna stop destroying the planet let just stop existing i get that we have to do something about the climate change and stuff but we ca stop producing new humans bcs of your carbon footprint if everyone would think that we would go extinct and i think no one wants that even if it would be probably the best thing that could happen tho the earth
i think it was a mix of global temperatures atmosphere content and lack of competition mammals had not evolved when dinosaurs existed so there was no evolutionary competition however the same was true for mammals after the dinosaurs went no competition since mammals thrived and only really small reptiles survived they could not grow as large again i sure that if climate change fucks us all over even more lizards will get bigger again due to warmer temperatures
just remember that turnbull was in charge for a few of those years he willing to tackle climate change now that it just meaningless talk that makes him look good but he sure as hell was willing enough to tackle it to sacrifice his own personal political gains
reminder of what chemicals are doing to animals in our environment i wish we would talk about the chemicals we are being exposed to and what they doing to sexual development like we treat climate change and vaccinations instead of eating horse paste going super far left woke with this is the worst thing the dems have ever done instead of talking about the truth that science is telling us is happening we being exposed to a shit load of chemicals that are mimicking estrogen and affecting fetuses like a hormone nuclear bomb potential health implications reported abnormalities in laboratory animals and wildlife exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals include feminization of males abnormal sexual behaviour birth defects altered sex ratios decreased sperm density decreased size of testes breast cancer testicular cancer reproductive failure and thyroid dysfunction
really the trump team really gives this sub a lot of low hanging fruit there was never really a consensus that the earth was flat the myth of the flat wiki is just that a myth ever since the ancient greeks worked out that the world was a sphere no scholar really challenged that conclusion and was successful geocentrism was a thing yes but hardly something that was supported through concrete data like climate change is geocentrism arose from observations but climate change is observed through observations and data so the two ca truly be compared there also a line about the world being years old i saying people have gotten things wrong throughout the year history of our planet i do know if he talking about the age of the earth or the length of human history so i give him benefit of the doubt here and assume he meant the latter
oh yeah same boat here i an australian and i kinda like a world superpower to like idk do something about climate change i guess before we all burn to death lol
this is the kind of stuff that makes it obvious that someone knows nothing of the topic climate change is a more comprehensive term since warming is not equal on all parts of the globe its hilarious that you think that a change of term somehow means that it must be a hoax it is the same as claiming evolution is not real because you just called it natural selection the denialism in this thread is disheartening
he is relevant because he can generally be understood to be a well educated man he is not nor was he ever a climate scientist he is an aerospace engineer with a bachelors degree from a state university his opinion has no more bearing on the climate change debate than your local mechanic or grocery bagger does this is a fallacious appeal to authority in that he is not an authority it almost certain that his disagreement with the theory is due to his ignorance of the topic a bachelors degree in an unrelated field does not qualify him to talk about this topic with any degree of authority
it very depressing that climate change is so far down on the list when that is the single biggest issue threatening the long term survival of humanity
anything tbh i attempt to convince someone of something and even debate a bit but honestly nothing to me is worth arguing about if someone is willing to argue a point they not likely to accept yours if i had to pick something specific though it be the validity of climate change
yep it funny that whenever globalists talk about climate change they conveniently leave out the amount of emissions that are a result of the global economy international shipping is one of the worst polluters bringing manufacturing back to the united states would cut down on a lot of emissions
two new studies released last week have revealed younger voters ages to have the power to influence ten competitive congressional races in the upcoming elections if only they get out and vote the first study from the pew research center has shown millennials are far more liberal than their parents on issues like climate change and they are much more likely to vote for democratic candidates the second study pinpointed ten congressional districts where millennial voters who make up percent of all adults might actually turn red districts blue
i mean the oncoming climate change as well as increasing inequality already makes the future super depressing
actually it really is her father he got into a heated argument with florida gov rick scott about climate change and gov scott had him arrested
i mean if you look at the people he has to debate with whenever he is on tv i can see why he would be condescending these networks always invite some idiot making ridiculous unscientific assertions that carbon dioxide is not a contributor to global warming or that human activity is only a small factor in it but then he supposed to not pretend like they total morons saying science is pretty much settled on this is not wrong nor does it make you a colossal douchebag it the networks that annoy me like when it about climate change they apparently think it necessary to invite a climate change denier as well as if his opinion is equally valid as someone who has a scientific understanding of the subject they make it seem like there are two sides to a coin when in reality these ignoramuses do even deserve to be on the same show also him being a mechanical engineer does preclude him from having a basic understanding of science he is going on these shows talking about the most complicated scientific subjects he just good at explaining basic concepts in a clear way you do need a phd for that it possible he is a douchebag in real life but i have seen it with my own eyes so far the people he usually has to debate do deserve to be taken seriously
no just no climate change will cause mass famine if nothing is done about it also this much warming could also bring along the next ice age although that is still a theory
disappointed he was made minister of the environment and climate change
i would expect that effective terraforming projects on earth have many obstacles land management population densities established industries political and economic conditions etc there are reasons global climate change and world hunger are still problems mars however is an empty canvas where terraforming concepts could be tested and proven such a mission could be just the impetus for progressive development here on earth
across almost all western nations in the past years the parties that have been elected have been increasingly more right winged and frequently even climate change deniers yet when parties like say the sweden democrats come up i almost never hear people on this sub complain about how they the only significant party in sweden not in favor of renewable energy if pushing for renewable energy and against climate change was actually a priority here that would not be the case
bruh this is inverse etn emphasis on inverse this means when the underlying asset goes down dgaz goes up and vice versa check it out natural gas is most likely going to take a huge shit due to increased production and this freak show warm winter caused by chinese hoaxsters which is tanking demand any vehicle which let you short natty gas is looking sweet disclaimer i in long
except heatwaves like this happen every few years and always have i not denying climate change but this is really that uncommon
there only real agurment is that its causing climate change and deforstation
daddy what does climate change look like
this is still bargaining everywhere is on the front lines of climate change in one way or another retreat from one hazard to another out of the frying pan and into the fire etc
do we want the cake be able to eat to it well nuclear might be the only way what i mean by that is that if people are unwilling to give up the current standards of living on petro then nuclear may allow us a species to continue to live with our current standards without the climate change aspect surrounding the use of fossil not saying nuclear is the best option here but given how people behave i want it all this may be our best option it more certainly has its risks and failure is a big big deal
i skeptical but warming to the idea i think my issues is how everyone stands around saying government is the solution taxes and regulations neither of these are solutions one is taxes which is how to fund something which is meaningless and the other is regulation which is another word for procedure and it left undefined so again useless so when people stand around calling others stupid for not believing in climate change i do know what else is beyond that it really just sounds like a blame game by people with no real solutions that is solutions outside people just voluntarily changing their habits flushing toilets less wasting less gas etc
so one attention seeking idiot created a lie about being the victim of satanic child abuse ring turned into dozens of convictions of daycare workers because people believed in an unfounded wholecloth fabrication conspiracy theory you acknowledge that climate change denial has a negative impact beyond the believers would rejection of science based findings contribute to the acceptability of other science claims are the people who reject the objective fact that earth is spherical and not flat contributing to the rejection of the much more complex concept of climate change do you think there are flat earthers who believe in climate change accepts academia conclusions on vaccines and anything else the satanic child abuse allegations of the was pushed by a single individual with some copycats and had the harmful effect of dozens of americans wrongfully imprisoned yet having a movement pushing this conspiracy theory has no unintended harmful consequences each individual who believes an counterfactual belief amplifies that dishonest discrepancy from reality lessen the value of facts if we as a society allow these people to propagate falsehoods we undermine truth that is harmful regardless of what the conspiracy theory is
so true my father keep telling me things will get better one day but he grew up in a time without all this shit when climate change was barely a thought every year the weather gets wilder record temperatures are set and the world is ravaged by one variant after another you would be crazy to think things will just resolve themselves
well it be great if you in the oil business keystone xl will be back on the table the paris agreement on climate change will be undone and any restrictions on drilling on land or sea will be removed r electricvehicles
climate change is something humans have survived before and will again volcano caused climate change could be argued to be more traumatic than what mankind has done personally i think pollution and ocean trash is a bigger threat than the and rising seas problem also the level of damage windmills do to bird populations does nt get enough airplay i m not saying climate change does nt exisnt or people have nt caused problems i m just saying be wary of any cause that has lots of money thrown at it or is often campaigned on without any action the cause campaigned on might not be bad but it is likely being used to manipulate you republicans used the gun issue to get elected for years by normal farmers who are not radical by any means then got america into the iraq war which has nothing to do with the gun debate
it actually all true find sources that prove me wrong climate change is real and harper and mulroney putting canada in record debt is also real look at doug ford history of friends and family appointments and scheer plan to deregulate development and subsidize oil more all of this is public information
but i have even got to the major reproducibility crisis in scientific studies yet further disproving the assertion that science can be settled even for something as obvious as climate change scientists constantly disagree about impact the models they produce are often orders of magnitude different in outcomes to say science can be settled what you mean is no further discoveries can be made shows a lack of understanding of science science is changing constantly as new hypothesises are tested and verified it also inherently not objective fact because a there a reproducibility crisis and b there are often opposite conclusions among literature
it hard to take the cult of climate change seriously when the buzzwords change every months to a year and when all the apocalypse like warnings prove to constantly be over exaggerated and outright false this on top of the cult scientists being caught in outright lies and data manipulation just saying
notley said she would put forward a strong climate change plan she did and it to defend the interests of albertans he said horgan promised he would defend the environment and defend the coastlines how can singh believe that notley has put forward a strong environmental policy while also believing that horgan has to defend the environment from her policies i a federal leader who will hold the federal government who is squarely responsible for this to account he said and what exactly would he do here because changing the review process wo stop the fighting
no it climate change
really his only reason was because he was brainwashed by fox news literally it sounds like i being hyperbolic but he used to watch fox news every night and fully believed every right wing talking point about democrats about a year ago i showed him a trevor noah video about how fox news thought obama wearing a tan suit was the biggest scandal in history and for some odd reason that was what broke the spell he said this is absolutely ridiculous and stopped watching fox news ever since then he slowly become less and less brainwashed for the first time months ago he said you know i do think i agree with trump on climate change that was the first time he ever disagreed with trump on anything he very very slowly begun realizing that he believed a bunch of lies and is seeing trump for who he really is he still has a long way to go but if beto is the nominee it will be the first time in his life he ever voted democrat
celebrities using their platform to inform people that someone is a piece of shit is relevant especially when the lyrics are fucking savage i said the same thinf about leo speaking out for climate change these people have a platform and why should they use it also like toy soldiers was a dope song
maybe massive climate change awareness campains propaganda lol i think having such a huge portion of the population so radically misinformed is a problem but it also an asset to many major corporations i think the only way to become a little more sustainable is to slowly claim our country back from the corporations aka socialism i do really have a better answer than that
i am an environmental scientist so i know what i talking about what a lot of organisations studies do is they limit their study to a country which means that yes if you look at the uk or other developed countries it will look like significant strides have been made but a lot of the emissions are being outsourced to other nation with the outsourcing of production a peak followed by a decrease since then coincides with the recession and the movement of a lot of industry abroad from the usa there are steps being made in the right direction but emissions are increasing across some industries such as agriculture due to growing populations and a growing global middle class so no i not clearly wrong and neither are all of the scientists who keep advocating for further steps to be taken to reduce climate change if you actually interested in looking into these things then the fao releases good papers every year on the topic
the conservative and or republican party does stand for what you describe okay has their stance on climate change higher education and god in government changed in the last minutes do tell because i love to start getting down to business it unfair generalizations you place over a whole half of the us due to your interactions with a few and misguided media motivations this is funny particularly because the interactions that guide my views on these matters come primarily from scientific research first and reading news stories from all over the world second not just paying attention to a few in the us amazingly that is actually pretty common for conservatives to do it kills dialogue before it can happen and fail on its own you had the perfect opportunity here to use my argument to open up a dialogue by presenting an argument of your own but you did you instead using the opportunity to explain that i making people not want to argue if that how you feel maybe you need to look inward for the reasons why i not telling anyone not to argue with me you made that decision on your own
the scottish highlands or southern appalachia the native biodiversity is amazing amp the soil is perfect for farming etc climate change will change that though
bernie considers global warming the most essential change to national security he opposed the establishment of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a notable effect on the climate bernie bot
this is my life i have a real troubles especially with empathy i want to solve the worlds problems and it physically makes ill sometimes to see the oil spill climate change etc etc or just the disasters that seem to effect peoples everyday life though i do nt really have any advice thought you might feel better knowing you are not the only one
anti vaxxers flat earthists people denying climate change etc they refuse to believe the scientific evidence and it honestly concerning
i do see any divergence in the current us situation sorry it was coming for long time a wuhanese eating a bat in fall and getting particularly nasty virus would be much bigger spike but also not that much divergences are anomalies from predicted chain of events both were likely so catastrophic events because of progressing climate change pandemic because of globalisation and continuation of wet markets or consequences of political and social degeneration in us are completely expected to happen they will happen more and more we are in the endgame now my fear is actually that those events will overlap each other not giving people and economy a respite in between maybe fall was apex of our civilisation
an alright movie for once did the world really need it probably not but it also not a detriment some of the characters seem a bit on the nose but nothing severe here either i just happy they did go out on a tangent about how this threat was all man made because of our reckless consumerism and the alleged ensueing climate change apart from that it was enjoyable if maybe a bit long the plot holes though at least in my opinion are glaring as always when time travel is involved everything gets kinda muddy so the people of the future were overrun by aliens but did find a way to create this sort of time travel thingy which for some reason however only works in set intervalls and exactly x years into the past but once the group is in training suddenly the next jump happens too soon they also telling people apparently that they were chosen because they did exist in the future which is kinda brutal while many of the past earthlings who had already died in the future go to the future to die again basically would all of this create several different time lines already the future force already changed the past by travelling back and informing earth of the danger their ridiculous goal is to send people from the past into the future to stop humanity extinction buuuut why do the people from the past care about this it is not their future they now have the information about the threat and how to combat it sacrificing the current population for a future that is already totally fucked no matter the outcome should even occur to them i guess you could say that the future humans know so much about the threat that the past humans want to know as much as they can and help them develop this virus if they even know about it until chris pratt gets sent forward but if the future humans could come up with this would the past humans also be capable of doing so they could probably contain the threat or take the counter measures by force it also a bit funny that the combined might of earth military failed to do what some bumbling idiots achieved and why did the daughter specifically send for her father he the only one who can do this why bullshit he a liability as we seen he would have died for nothing jumping after his daughter to his certain doom and by telling him all of what happened in the past she basically changed his entire life as well and potentially prevented his death creating a completely different time line again nobody of course saw the mass of creatures coming for them and they seem kinda weak but then unstoppable from scene to scene reuniting with his daughter back home was touching though and well acted now that that out of the way they somehow infiltrating russian airspace which is likely closely monitored since the country has closed its borders landing somewhere in the middle of nowhere finding the alien location by accident and deciding it would be best if they all take care of this themselves instead of at least sending guys back with all the information they say they do have time dude you have almost years at least secure the evidence in case something goes wrong which is very likely so of course the things wake up after the first ones die violently because they failed to check out the entire ship and realize there thousands of them down in the hold and then they want to blow the ship up but when did they plant the charges and how many did they really get them all probably not maybe there another ship and they conclude all of this from one claw they basically found decades later it just seems very naive the movie got a lot of stupid tropes comedic black guy who ca shoot but still somehow makes an impact they ask a school boy at least they set it up about the volcanoes instead of a renowned vulcanologist they have several women often at high ranks who basically do nothing and are seemingly just there for the quota another black guy who is angry at everything and it revealed it because he has cancer tragic and i not even really complaining it a sci fi action flick it deserves to have its stupid elements but the whole time travel plot hole kinda annoyed me a lot better than army of the dead does really need a sequel though enjoyable but ultimately forgettable though i imagine this is what an invasion of zergling hydralisks would look like nicely animated monsters
wildlife the real victims of human made climate change
not climate change but life in general this is it no life after death to prepare for i am a much kinder patient person now
going to have to go against the grain and agree with this while moving away from the current system is ideal we do need to conflate that fight with the fight against climate change as that only makes both easier to dismiss as communist bullshit or whatever the neoliberals come up with the issue with the climate is literally life or death so it takes top priority does mean that the only thing that should be focused on either

because of inherent selfishness imagine you are the ceo of a company that is undeniably very bad for the environment you could try to change things about this company but that would cost your company a lot of money and profit sure there will be horrible consequences but those things will occur after you died which is actually true so why should you sacrifice your time and money for something that the other generation will have to deal with at least i think this is how those people think now imagine this train of thought on a much smaller scale why should you have to do the effort of finding a garbage can if you just throw this plastic bottle on the ground there is no negative consequence in it for you another possible reason is that the general public does quite understand what the consequences of climate change will be we would all be freaking out right now if everyone understood how dangerous the rapid decline of insect populations is
of course a stateless society would be pretty sweet because every time someone misbehaves it not a stateless society anymore crime is not a state organized crime is violence monopoly on violence for rule enforcement organization scenarios where a stateless society might fail what do you do if corporations have more power than voters and constantly shift your democracy to favor their interests what do you do if the majority elects representatives who choose judges that support the subjugation of minorities and initiate said oppression what do you do if your country elects representatives that grow the military as a primarily offensive force and that force starts a coup what if politicians who are flawed judgemental humans like ourselves get bought out by other interests what if nobody really understands or cares about climate change enough to vote for the right kind of solutions do we just let the earth be destroyed so that the general public can have their will heard what if the only way to sustain growth is to take a multi year economic hit now but term limits are only years how do you have politicians that will be willing to make themselves unelectable for the sake of the country what if most of the actual power in the country is held by unelected appointees and the people who are voted on only hold a small portion of overall power how do you give the choices of leadership to the general public and ensure they are educated enough to make good choices how do you address the massive negative externality of democracy uneducated voters what if they make destructive choices because they are easily swayed by influential and charismatic people what do you do if people vote to keep their military so small that they are easily defeated what do you do if people vote to be paid money via government deficit draining the system until nobody wants to buy bonds anymore and the whole thing implodes what do you do if the people are very violent and tribalistic and every time you try to hold a vote it turns into bloodshed what do you do if they have elections but votes get thrown out and the same winner is picked every time we established reasonable checks and balances fundamentally there are no checks and balances because the people who do the checking are appointed by the groups of people they check like it or not there is a political class that exists as its own separate entity and the people only have some partial control over who gets entry
now do the same for climate change
bernie considers climate crisis the most essential change to national security he opposed the manufacturing of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a noteworthy effect on the climate bernie bot
climate change bathroom break for me
there were about a thousand protesters in victoria its time for canada to shake its head and do something about climate change
do you believe in climate change their administration will increase your taxes
just ask environment canada watches alert you about weather conditions that are favorable for a storm or severe weather which could cause safety concerns as certainty increases about the path and strength of a storm system a watch may be upgraded to a warning which is an urgent message that severe weather is either occurring or will occur warnings are usually issued six to hours in advance although some severe weather such as thunderstorms and tornadoes can occur rapidly with less than a half hour notice only the first one a watch was issued the latter a warning was issued anywhere on thursday
its hot nowadays with the climate change and all or it could be the financial hardship everyone is experiencing not everyone has the money to buy a shirt especially when you buy them packs
even that did do it for my family they just insist that it always been this way when droughts and heat waves are killing okra of all things it most certainly has not always been this way they wo admit climate change is a thing until they own beachfront property in central alabama and maybe not even then
climate change
i do care about climate change and the declaration of a climate emergency will do sweet fuck all without action backing it as it turns out so far that action has mainly been the phasing out of coal boilers by which is at least something
meanwhile there is an actual environmental emergency going on loss of biodiversity and climate change we facing extinction but this is the emergency they are obsessing over they seem so desperate for any chance to make the liberals look bad and completely unwilling to find ways to deal with actual problems
yea and climate change is man made either head in the sand good lad
the quoted argument seems to be entirely predicated upon the notion of future effective public policy addressing mitigation and adaptation concerns however climate legislation and international agreements thusfar have been woefully insufficient to what is needed to address climate change as such i not really sold on the idea that having children is advisable because we likely solve the problem down the road
we have a democrat and republican problem on climate change both are protecting the climate destroyers big business one does it through denial the other does it hiding by the culprits
i would suggest that if more people began applying the scientific method in their life choices and world views then not only would religion evaporate but so would pseudoscience actually instead of more people how about people of influence that would include politicians and the extremely rich now imagine the next presidential election the republicans would support the aca stop denying climate change and stop claiming this is a christian nation
see also climate change is a problem but we ca afford any kind of carbon pricing or anything else for that matter yeah the ontario sex ed curriculum needs updating but not enough parents were consulted
why was gender dysphoria removed from the after reading about classification it seems that if it is removed this makes it less likely for treatment to be covered from an insurance perspective for example medical cannabis is shown to alleviate ptsd symptoms and pain in areas but as it is high schedule drug federally it is not covered if these treatments are shown to in cases improve wellbeing would it be better to classify it as more definite in todays climate mental health is being further destigmatized but to remove the label of gd seems counter productive imo also i feel that declassifying it does not serve this disorder justice while objectively true it is a mental illness its affect on a person mental state is more than significant i met people who have gd and to them their internal struggle with identity is in many cases debilitating to them mentally to them it is just as much of a crisis as anything else if i could compare it to anything else i would say anorexia the idea of being disgusted with your body and wishing to do anything to change it
the family rescue plan cut child poverty in the us in half with the expanded tax credits i hope you are calling your senators about the build back better plan it will put more money in parents pockets provide affordable childcare free community college expand medicare and has climate change policy it a potentially transformative bill if it can get passed in its current form
this is a smaller part of the problem the larger reason is that the republican party is captured by two major interest groups with an active interest in denying scientific evidence religious fundamentalists and industries which contribute negatively to climate change
never said this was not true socialism just said that the tech state of mind and moreso the environmental situation is very different from a single example everyone love to present you still yet to establish why this is somehow different the weak point in normalizing per production is that it assumes that all production is necessary which is not true that an assertion but it not one that you can really support here when people are free to produce as they see fit in a market environment they do just produce for nothing production is driven by consumer demand and that is something you can unilaterally declare as unnecessary based on your preferences as capitalism encourages unnecessary production for the sake of eternal growth while socialism does no bullshit enough with the ridiculous talking points that have no basis in reality all economies must continuously grow including socialist ones because they have population growth so to use your argument two billion people producing each is polluting more than same number of people producing x each this is not my argument i talking about pollution in sum total the planet does not care if a total amount of pollution of is coming from billion people or the planet sees a worse impact from amount of total pollution than it does from x amount of pollution even if the x amount is produced by million people instead having a common sense argument is not my prerogative i make a claim and i support it with something based on math or logic etc having no links to support is does not make it untrue moreover links can be misleading as we saw you re welcome to discuss stuff the same way if you will make me to see a logic fallacy in my claims by logic i will not require links to be convinced it is quite sad that you need directions on what to think and ca nt make up your own mind i been giving logical statements all throughout so this is true huff post is indeed left leaning in story selection but not actually misleading in fact checking false the reporting has numerous claims that are not supported by the facts in fact your media bias website itself leans left might as well be referencing snopes while you at it to add another simple argument which could be easily demonstrate the difference and to use much feared common logic how would you compare trumps vs bernies environmental policies and how does this resonates with your argument do you think that trump being a clear representative if capitalism is so worried about environment he denied global warming until very recently while bernie having lets say socialist inclination is suggesting having a green new deal which is very focused on environment the green new deal has been widely shown to be a disaster even by metrics used by the ipcc report on climate change which clearly showed that implementing such measures would make us worse off than waiting to deal with it climate change using ipcc defeat un climate if you want to talk about logic then you have to use actual cost benefit analysis and not just mindless virtue signalling about environmental activism oh and no trump is not clearly representative of capitalism he is the head of the state which is the opposite of capitalism
they not fighting climate change seriously their vehicles use the same resources that every other car does except for the gasoline those resources steel lithium etc are themselves carbon intensive to extract produce and transport giving everyone a tesla would be an environmental catastrophe we should be investing in mass transit instead
that is utter bullshit for two reasons firstly the fireworks are paid for by local government bodies not the state or federal governments to whom mining companies pay or not their taxes to secondly even if those companies were paying correct taxes do you seriously think this government is going to use that money to properly fund fire services or enact climate change policies that can help with the current situation going forward
just institute a world wide one child policy it is too late to stop climate change all we can do now is mitigate the severity there are too many people
what motivates them well i kinda was one i left the repubilcan party in after trump was nominated i realized that the party was not what i thought it was at all if this obvious con man was the face of it and it triggered a serious bout of self reflection if that had done it the baffling anti mask bullshit would have done it i feel like i decompressing from a cult and i not alone that gigantic win for biden is proof republicans with an ounce of fucking sense and whose families would literally murder them for it flipped parties so who left by january lunatics die hards who would rather feed the constitution into a chipper shredder and support actual treason against the government than see the guy with the d next to his name win an election people with soft lives who have never suffered or struggled for anything who are free to treat politics like a sports match civil rights legislation passing or failing is to them just points on the board nobody they know is actually going to get or lose any civil rights so it very distant let me tell you about my grandfather he was a huge asshole and a staunch republican his whole life he also fought in world war ii firing a cannon in germany at the bloody end of the war he was at the battle of the bulge he would have fomented a fucking riot over trump he would have never accepted such a man as president and i wo tell you his cure for sedition but i sure you can guess what left of the republican party are spoiled losers who see themselves as my grandfather they have his asshole attitudes and his backward views and his century rural american level of education but they ca muster a scrap of his courage fortitude or actual ideals they larp around as cops or non combat military guys and imagine themselves as heirs to the prestigious lineage of the heroes who saved the world keep in mind that for most of them their history education stops at high school and american high school history take on this is basically all of europe was fucked until daddy america showed up and started handing out knuckle sandwiches until the bad people were dead and the world was saved and for as much as i praised my grandfather here him and men like him did some serious damage to this country as well the republican worldview requires a tremendous amount of upkeep it takes time and energy and money to maintain for being the guys who gratuitously hate virtue signaling they engage in it rapaciously you have to watch listen to read only pundits who frame arguments in a very specific way and can conveniently exclude facts that contradict their point fox news was always on my dad would take me to work construction with him and we listen to talk radio the whole time he ask me questions about it and make sure i was engaged the youth pastors at my church which we attended twice a week were openly republican and taught that it was god party and all the good people are republican i used to get ann coulter and mark steyn books for christmas no matter what i asked for as an aside my first inkling that the whole thing is bullshit is when i tried out some ann coulter arguments on my high school classmates and some random highschooler fucking destroyed her arguments and i had no answer because her books cover only cherry picked counterarguments and the handwaves my god how many rhetorical and mental techniques did i learn to brush away inconvenient voices without actually considering their arguments the source is biased of course you think that way academia is run by marxists that person has stupid tumblr hair eventually you get good enough at it that you can walk right by the truth slapping you square in the face and say what an odd occurence oh well off to bust my ass as a dishwasher at a restaurant because if i work hard enough that will somehow make me a millionaire i invest or something i mean i not doing it now but later some day you can do anything if you put your mind to it difference i definitely noticed after hanging out with more leftists and something i would have vehemently denied as a republican even though it obviously true leftists gather facts and draw a conclusion from that data although their personality biases how they interpret it rightists start with what they believe to be true and gather facts to support it right wing ideas have become so at odds with reality here that they starting to require full on conspiracy theories to justify which they have to engage in because of the way their worldview works if you want to keep on believing that climate change does real you have to be ready to get on board the jewish space laser train now repeat with mass shootings being crisis actors covid being a ploy by bill gates and big mask so circling back to my original statement this party has been shedding reasonable people for a long time there were absurd conspiracy theories swirling around the clintons and way worse ones around obama as the mind virus grew then it metastasized fully into qanon and we reached the crossroads of destiny either you can bail out of this flaming fucking car before it hits the bottom of the ravine or you can gear up to be the party of anti vaxxers and open white supremacists everyone with a lick of sense has already bailed and those that are left are the kind of incompetent terrifying violent drunken lunatics who are angry enough to try to destroy the government but lazy and stupid enough to film themselves doing it and then try to walk away like nothing happened and if they get away with it that it it over we live in a country where bullets count for more than votes the military will run the joint briefly then who knows maybe we get our very own napoleon maybe we get a series of brutal dictators who keep looting the economy for decades and brutalizing anybody who different not on my fuckin watch not if i have anything to say about it
sorry to hear you are suffering from ocd i pretty sure i have never had ocd but i was diagnosed with panic disorder so i no stranger to anxiety intrusive thoughts catastrophic thinking etc i definitely not scrupulous anymore i try to be a good person and i do my best to avoid harming others but recognize that i never be perfect and that i do bad things and that ok i do help everyone i could and yes that bad but it also ok it ok to be an imperfect person who does bad things sometimes i embrace the fact that i am no saint and consequently i cut others some slack too people are going to do bad shit to me sometimes but i am going to do some bad shit too so it only fair for me to let it go i never felt this way as a catholic because the list of bad things was so long and so arbitrary and the stakes were so high eternal torture vs deification beatific vision that i found everything to be overwhelming and unbearable as far as being focused on secular morality would you say you obsess about climate change veganism politics social justice issues
i agree i understand the disenfranchisement i was there for a minute when to me it felt like we nominated hillary but biden is at least making progressive promises and his campaign if advertised solely to me is do burn the fucking country down it hurts to take the beating when the clock is ticking on climate change and i not getting any younger when it comes to comprehensive healthcare but there is another choice progressives lost the battle so now it time to dig in and pray we do lose the war even if it means the next generation gets the things i always wanted but i wo and biden easily clinching this election without a shadow of a doubt is hill number one to die on
still people taking minute showers is not the reason for climate change ohthankgod
think about it if sea levels rise and destroy infrastructure on the coast that trillions of dollars of loss just one example essentially it all comes down to value lost from the destruction climate change would cause if we do take the economic hit now we will take a much more severe hit later and have less options and less resources to combat climate change which will also make fighting climate change even more expensive not to mention the loss of human life
we actually do know that completely the winter hemisphere polar vortex is more affected by vertical heat transfer from planetary waves and there is still debate as to whether warmer low latitudes should strengthen or weaken it it also linked to other large scale oscillations like the qbo and enso which may be influenced by climate change as well i think it would lead to a weaker circulation due to weaker meridional temp vort gradient similar to how the amoc in the ocean has slowed but the jury is still out no stratospheric warming trends exist because the data available is storied enough
except that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that storms are a result of emissions legit question do people say that storms like hurricanes are getting worse because as climate change gets worse ocean temperatures are increasing which leads to more powerful and destructive
huh did you and i read the same article the article says blackrock want to see their investments have solid risk mitigation strategies in place to account for climate change this is basically the definition of long term strategy there is nothing short term about having a serious plan for dealing with climate change do you realize the implications here they are basically saying that climate deniers are unwelcome on boards they hold influence over culturally this is huge small incremental adjustments in attitude over time is what changes culture this is much more than that and its a huge deal
i agree but none of those things are realistic in a political climate where there a despot on one side and a man who is unwilling to fundamentally change healthcare in america so what can local and state governments do given they will not be receiving the support they need from the fed
here are a few politics racism economy vaccines climate change
if anything it will look like us and we will resemble the shape form from now until forever as we no longer have survival of the fittest we got to this point because of natural selection humans have lived through both hotter and much colder climates than today my degree was environmental science and i also studied archaeology amp geology along side my degree and work directly dealing with climate change as part of my job it not a scorched earth scenario we are heading into in the long term it get hot first sure but then we more likely to end up in a snowball earth scenario ones the gulf stream breaks down
i personally strongly believe runaway climate change is already underway and even without human emissions the feedback loops already in play are heating the world up on their own we are just adding fuel to the fire with our emissions i think we are well beyond the point of being able to stop this ride now we needed to act in the at the latest to prevent our doom but instead we hit the accelerator boe will be soon certainly in the next to years each degree warmer we get will speed up the heating more i think come we are going to be struggling with our environment social unrest food and water and habitability
if you and a few million others changed your consumption habits it would make a noticeable difference especially if all of yous voted for better environmental policies and continued influencing others and like sure think it smug but at least you did something instead of put your own selfish need to eat meat or buy cheap clothes above what you know is best for the planet and a populace that is mostly veggie already by choice is going to react as badly when the government imposes heavy meat taxes or whatever i agree that things do look great politically and that the people actually in power do do even near enough but what else are us common folks going to do give up lie down and die and the people in power are even less likely to do what needed if there no pressure from below and on a positive note people are a hell of a lot more aware and receptive these days when it comes to climate change and the things we can do to combat it and brexit has happened yet
arctic melt is a big part of climate change and has major repercussions in canada politically as well as environmentally you probably do have to go in to arctic sovereignty and things like that melt is weakening canada claim to the pole denmark and russia are rattling their sabres a bit but you can talk about shrinking polar bear territory this threatens both their species livelihood and also there have been some incursions by hungry bears into northern communities climate change is also changing fish population the water is warming they are changing their location and are dying off this has huge repercussions for native populations and on people who make their living on fishing for grade that should be good but if i can make a suggestion push the envelope a little make climate change a symptom of a bigger issue it a symptom of canada shift to an fossil fuel based economy which has myriad other problems associated with it fracking native territory rights dirty water the tar sands it opens a whole kettle of fish
i have you know that i saw a scientific documentary where climate change caused a giant tornado with sharks in it i very much respect what climate change scientists have predicted and i terrified please take this low effort commentary back to or dankmemes where it belongs
applied environmental science climate change is true and by that i mean that a change is taking place that is agreed upon by everyone this change is related to man made influences a shotty short explanation carbon monoxide co is a greenhouse gas it is a component of the atmosphere and adding more from cars mainly carbon monoxide to the atmosphere raises temps on our planet carbon monoxide makes up an extremely small of the atmosphere and the atmosphere is in a balance or in science what they call static equilibrium so artifically disturbing this balance creates warmer temps humans appear to be adding so much carbon to the atmosphere that its disturbing this balance and causing a change a climate change
i think it more likely that climate change is a catalyst for things that eventually cause the infection but we see i guess
building rail is too expensive for any company that why it must be done by the country when the rail is built you can see examples of highly successful european private companies building rail is hugely expensive but building it and maintaining it is much much cheaper than maintaing the roads in the us and it helps fight the climate change
here is what will happen people like you wo vote because if dems ca keep their promises what the fucking difference here will be the options republicans who actively destroy the environment dems who promise to fix it but then compromise with republicans where they let republicans destroy the environment but the dems hold a news conference saying they are concerned about climate change when people see this they do leave the dems to vote for republicans they just stop voting
gazprom the russian government actively support climate change climate change would make russia more livable and accessible to oil and gas drilling and it would open up the arctic sea for international shipping
our northern territories are going to be getting very geopolitically important very quickly because of climate change the northwest passage is going to be a viable alternative to the panama canal for shipping between china and europe we need to have a strong presence up there for the sake of the people who live there and for sovereignty
occasionally someone is gon na shout about india too well they are the third most polluting country in the world and the one with the highest annual rise in emissions so they deserve to be shouted at especially as they already get actively fucked by climate change
just because there a royal family does mean they should keep giving news about them there more important news like crime poverty climate change etc royalty is just ceremonial fluff it not important the queen ca decide important things
i do deny climate change either i just do see the present alternative power solutions as credible or proposed legislation as effective and non destructive
i cried multiple times throughout the rally in my circle of acquaintances i by far the most concerned about climate change but at the strike i felt like i simply fit in
who else wants to watch the climate change voyeurism no
why do people do evil things free will it not gods fault climate change god has control over everything story checks out
it seems to me that to say that there is no truth or certainty is a claim to certainty correct i typed that at and reading it just now i realized that i did type what i was actually thinking that should have read as far as human knowledge goes there is no truth or certainty i was referring to the way i and most skeptics think about it so i can go about my day to day life why would they use precise language when everything else they do in their line of work is so precise because the vast majority of the time when they say things like that they not in their line of work they interacting with non scientists it one of those difference between different colloquial uses of the word this is actually a very deep and timely issue when scientists write papers articles scholarly stuff etc they are usually very precise they never say anything with certainty or at least almost never when they talking to eachother they probably use language like that but it does matter because everybody knows what they mean the rub is when they talking to non scientists who do approach the word from the midset of nothing is certain everything is in degrees of likeliness as far as your average everyday schmo is concerned most things are black and white not grey something is either up or down alive or dead moving or still as you hopefully know however none of those are actually binary like that all of them are on a spectrum so when a scientist talks to that schmo either directly or via an intermediary like a reporter or something one of three things can happen note that these are generally in order of experience the scientist is prepared for that difference in mindset and speaks colloquially like he she would to other scientists they say something is certain when that not actually what they mean this used to happen a lot more that it does now as everyone seems to be hyper aware of the abusive power of mass media the scientist goes the opposite direction and assumes that everything they say will be taken literally so they get super paranoid and qualify every little word they say this is what happened with the whole field of climatology about years ago unsuspecting climate scientists got ripped out of their quiet climate labs and thrown into the middle of one of the hottest and most divisive political issues in the past half century a few of them made mistake and now the entire community is super gun shy about saying anything definitive the problem with this is that when they say things like as far as we know and so far the evidence shows that same average schmo takes that to mean that we still not sure that the jury is still out that all fine and good for discussion of nuanced issues that legitimately are still being worked out like consciousness intestinal bacteria dark matter but it problematic with things like climate change evolution homeopathy etc we are as sure as we could possibly be about those but the qualifying language confuses the crap out of non scientists especially the ones on the opposite side of a political issue the scientist is aware of the differences between public and academic language has practiced both and knows which words to apply at what times to make sure that the appropriate message comes across this is obviously the ideal situation but it pretty rare most scientists are too busy doing actual science to learn how to communicate to the public there are a few that have been outstanding neil degrass tyson bill nye lawrence krauss carl sagan phil plait steven novella etc people like that study and learn what non scientists are going to think when they use different language they then spend a lot of time developing the skill of getting super complex ideas across clearly and appropriately actually dr tyson has spend a lot of time trying to convince the rest of the scientific community that it a skill they all should develop all that said all of them are aware of that all knowledge is subject to change if new evidence comes to light push any scientist to get specific about it and they all say the same thing no matter what certainty you talking about as far as all the evidence shows it true we should teach kids it true i believe it to be true yes it true but if you show me reliable evidence to the contrary i immediately change my mind and thank you for proving me wrong whew wall of text edit btw thanks for the fun discussion
the airborne culture in alaska is nowhere near what it is like at bragg unless things have changed mightily in the past few years there i do know how many jumps you did at bragg but it seemed that everyone i was with in was barely staying current on jump status like there were numerous years that i did not hit double digits and i was actively trying to strap hang as much as i could to go to jump master school i honestly ca compare to other bases or the current command climate but fort richardson jber is an incredibly awesome post if you willing to take advantage of it if you like to hunt fish hike or ski you be hard pressed to find a better army post is a young brigade like barely a decade old and was recently spared temporarily from being downsized as part of the cutbacks depending on your mos and your attitudes regarding cold weather i suggest giving jber an honest look anchorage has all the amenities of any small midsize city with some of the best seafood you ever eat at least in my years there it never really felt like big army was really aware of us and those guys that came from units back at bragg would come in all hard charging saying they were going to change things then the first day of running on icy roads hits and suddenly pt sessions get moved to flo pancake house all that being said fuck fort wainwright avoid at all costs
hi can i ask you about the best places that will be affected the least by climate change i want to emigrate i am trying to find good candidates
because we are burning everything into the ground all emissions are a result of using natural resources how long is that sustainable for look up tim garret for a brief but worthwhile argument we are already bearing witness to anthropomorphic climate change and that will only accelerate plus we gave the collapse of the biosphere if the insect apocalypse is enough for you to see what going on then i honestly do know what else to give you our way of life on this scale is compatible with a single planet sure there are measures that we could take to delay the collapse but there really are no signs that such measures are happening indeed if anything our problems only seem to be accelerating biosphere collapse and climate change go hand in hand i do hope for collapse but its clearly evident given our current set of living arrangements
oh an american does like thunberg because she not charismatic enough is that about right listen i also an american and i do know if you noticed but we do talk about climate change here the world is literally being run by people like clarkson the three most powerful nations have figurehead leaders all of whom are immature irresponsible egotistical self centered soft handed manchildren with fragile egos emperor pooh putin the queen of drag and the orange manbaby are the official face of humanity and in all likelihood none of them are actually in charge or control of anything they all surrounded by sycophants just like them who are all ideal cult followers or would be machiavelli and these incompetent clowns actually run things they being the only people on earth dumb enough to believe the idiots above them on the chain belong there our world is very literally being run by fully grown children and meanwhile half of america does even vote and does care about politics because they themselves refuse to grow up as well the situation as it stands is fucking ridiculous to the point of being outright comical especially seeing as we know that the worst case scenario would involve us all dying and with that on the table we do even talk about it thunberg does not have to be charismatic she has a simple message that the world needed to hear it was not intended to change any minds it was a fair warning you are all imbeciles we all need to take responsibility for this and act right and anyone who does had better plan for retirement because this dumb bullshit is officially over we are legion it may be hard to believe but assuming the worst does come to pass in the next two decades give or take sweeping change will come to the world as the post net gens gently but firmly take the world out of the hands of the hopeless pre net gens it not a matter of age it about willingness to adapt to the new world as it comes about the will to grow and the people running things now simply do not have that and time will see them dealt with if the rough hands of the young do
well hello redditor for a year instead of splitting leftists bernie sanders himself just endorsed joe bye don just sanders endorses and they are working together to form task groups to create policy so if you trying to split us real leftists kindly fuck off we really like what joe biden offers compared to what trump gives us joe biden wants a minimum wage opposes the death penalty and seeks to abolish capital punishment supports decriminalizing cannabis and thinks convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources received a voting record from the national education association nea showing a pro teacher union voting record supports comprehensive sex education strongly believes in climate change he introduced the first climate change bill in congress in and wants the us to re join the paris agreement advocates for stronger gun control wrote the assault weapons ban and is called a true enemy of gun owners rights by the nra strongly opposes trump daca decision and wants to revert it supports gay marriage rights and legislation and advance regulations and policies that prohibit discrimination against transgender people drafted the violence against women act in to proescute domestic violence wants to codify roe wade into federal law and seeks to appoints supreme court justices who uphold roe wade supports the hyde amendment fought for amendments to a bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines opposes drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources supports a public health insurance option was a cosponsor of the employee free choice act strengthening unions biden opposes the privatization of social security and was given an approval rating from the alliance for retired americans ara is a vocal opponent of russia and vladimir putin sources death penalty biden appears to be softening his stance on the death joe biden death cannabis joe biden supports decriminalizing marijuana stops short of calling for politics joe biden marijuana decriminalization nea voting record sex education nea voting record climate change gun control daca gay marriage violence against women roe v wade hyde amendment drilling in arctic public health option privatization of social security russia minimum wage
then they can go find one of bezos private jets and deflate that if we all stopped driving today climate change would barely slow down due to the rich causing of global emissions but ya blame people going to work in there cars
yes it probablistic but we know the probability of events like this has risen we also know statistically lots more events like this are regularly happening now than ago so no you ca say this one event is proof of climate change but you can say this is one example of the statistically significantly observed increase in extreme weather events predicted by global warming you can also say romney is reckless boasting how he ignores climate change
it does need to be said climate change has made many places more habitable for viruses making it easier for them to multiply infect and mutate
it seems like people are judging it based on what specific genre they think it should have been like it was meant to be a dark comedy is it i just took it as a commentary on our real life crisis of climate change some of that is played for laughs and some of it is terrifying if that what the movie is then it succeeds
first everyone supports gun control i never heard any responsible person suggest ordinary citizens ought to have bazookas or shoulder mounted surface to air missile launchers the only debate is where the proper line is for america that line is probably somewhere near the to my original point take any other issue for example gay marriage years ago i was opposed to it but as i learned more about the issue i come around and at the same time i learned that i held some bigotry in my heart in those younger days the republican party still oppose it in order to appeal to their evangelical base trickle down economics same story climate change same story healthcare reform same story time and again conservatives ignore new information and stick with the policy positions that are dictated by the ultra wealthy power players
the laws are there mostly because courts can do very much about these groups making misleading videos they rely on evoking imagery of insinuating all livestock live in filth cramped quarters etc that is really something you can prosecute if you could actually prosecute things like that we have climate change deniers anti gmoers anti vaxxers etc removed from public discourse for misleading the public too but that not how things work these groups easily eat up trespassing charges etc as a cost of doing business in order to get attention with a video regardless of how misleading it is pr takes priority over immediately reporting actual animal abuse for these groups like with almost any science topic the initial story gets all the attention and the correction is almost always ignored those groups know that so there not much that can be done to counteract them legally unless you start directly cracking down on these very habits
climate change should be what re unite us as humans it a struggle we all face
when i repeat their search terms in repec i get at least two papers although not exactly recent especially the second one haurin the regional distribution of population migration and qje huntington climatic change and agricultural exhaustion as elements in the fall of qje but more importantly there is lot of research applicable to climate change even if does put those exact words into its title or abstract several qje papers from jel q qje search seem relevant
holy fuck it all boils down to climate change are you fucking kidding lol
there is proof that believing one conspiracy theory makes you more open to believing others the definition of what a conspiracy theory is can be where there contention if you believe that both climate change denial and this bomb denial bunk are conspiracy theories you already have proof you probably never going to get direct proof about two specific beliefs there basically no way to research such a thing with any accuracy
we are so far behind on climate change that our headlines are the most basic obvious science you could ever learn
i mean whether it spooky astrological bullshit or something else it happening climate change is gon na get pretty fucking real over the next several years
if you heard of the size of the california fires then this is a good comparison for how large the ones here in australia are our prime minister and current government are scum they doing nothing and actually decreased funding to our fire fighters earlier in the year despite multiple authorities advising them that fire risk was higher than ever climate change is real and we need to do something about it get angry i am
i still years out from what generally considered old age and with climate change hitting the fan not or years from now but right fucking now truth be told i think i be long dead
conservatives are more likely to be religious who in turn are more likely to deny scientific news energy environment this fascinating chart on faith and climate change denial has been reinforced by new
is this a theory in the same way climate change is a theory where it actually fact unless you are a republican
some folks have given their thoughts but i share mine as well from an economic standpoint it a little bit more affordable here than la maybe cheaper which is insignificant but you not going to be swimming in savings either there also no state income tax so if you in a wfh profession for example that automatic raise it still an expensive city but less so than la that said despite doing well for ourselves here we recognized and decided that our dollars can carry us farther in other parts of the country that we like to consider for longer term residency preferably somewhere with more sun the climate is drastically different than la night and day the winters are rainy and dark and it usually pitch black by pm starting in late october through mid late february how it impacts you though i found is entirely subjective and your experience will probably depend on how you approach it having spent years in the socal sun i think i banked enough daylight that the last years have not hit me very hard that not to say i do get over the dark winters every year but i do fall into a deep depression either i try to appreciate the change of pace shift activities to ones that are better suited for wet weather and fly back to socal once or twice to get a break of sun when summer gets here though it absolutely perfect beautiful weather some nights you do realize it already pm because there still a little sunlight out this summer arrived late and now that it here has been particularly hot so far though in both wet and dry weather though the nature is outstanding if you love green trees forests etc you will be in heaven here the pnw can be and is a breathtaking region of the us homelessness drug use and transients are an issue as some have pointed out i live in ballard and there are rvs and tents stationed up many of the main streets they do usually get into the actual neighborhoods unless they passing through so it does generally interfere with my personal space based on my last visit home to the el segundo mdr sm area in march it not much different from what i saw in some of my old neighborhoods my thoughts are if you grew up in la and it did get to you you can probably weather that element here too the seattle freeze can be a thing for you but again i found your mileage will vary it has not been the case for us the neighborhood we moved into has lots of friendly people and we became fast close friends with several of them i found the city to be very accessible even as a social introvert there something for everyone culturally it not as diverse as la but it would be silly to expect it to be seattle metro population is about million la million and well california is california politically the seattle area is pretty liberal but gets red very quickly once you venture out of the city centers if that matters to you as some mentioned you might get a raised eyebrow if you tell someone in seattle that you from la but you will get outright disgust in some of the mountain communities all in all we really enjoyed our time here and are grateful for it we moved here for work and there are many worse places that we could have had to relocate to if you can i would recommend you spend a week or so here and pretend you a local live a couple of days like you might if you lived here versus being a tourist and that might give you an idea if this could be for you
neoliberals were some of the first people to back carbon you go back to the milton friedman was an advocate of also neoliberals are opposed to the government doing things we generally just do like market distortions or anti market policies we like liberalized markets but there room for government involvement to achieve certain goals and correct market failures in general what i advocating over all areas of policy would likely see a freer market and less government involvement in the economy but better environmental policy and a more proactive welfare state even with lower to net neutral levels of spending the people who would not want any policies or taxes implemented would likely be anarcho capitalists or uber classical liberals not to mention that populists and social conservatives tend to deny climate change plenty
so the mega corps have spent the last years telling us that we can fix climate change if we just drive efficient vehicles and recycle and stuff how about they do something anything to curb their emissions instead of fucking gaslighting the entire planet
even though i know you are mocking me i going to answer your questions and then if afterwards you do cut this crap out once amp for all i will be blocking you i believe moon landing is real i do not believe flat earth i do believe in climate change and that its man made i believe the government was involved in or at the very least knew about ahead of time and still did intentionally let happen in order to institute legislation like the patriot act and expand their power in the middle east particularly the opium poppy fields in afghanistan and the oil in iraq i do believe that the holocaust was absolutely real and million people actually more when counting both jewish people and non jews were murdered by the nazis i do believe covid is real however i also believe that the virus was deliberately engineered through gain of function research in china funded by anthony fauci bill gates klaus schwab and other elites and that it was either an accidental lab leak which does change let alone minimize or eliminate the evil if the virus was indeed engineered in the lab or was even intentionally released in order to create a global crisis that they could use to not only profit massively from as they all have but also to justify taking the steps that erode every last vestige of people freedom and human rights and bring about the great global reset and industrial revolution basically a plutocratic surveillance state like china social credit system in which in the words of klaus schwab you will own nothing and be happy i do believe that the democratic primary elections were rigged against bernie sanders in and and that he was threatened into dropping out and endorsing clinton and biden however i do necessarily believe that the general election was rigged by the same token i do dismiss the possibility outright either i do not believe in the existence of a jewish conspiracy to take over the world but yet i do believe that there is a conspiracy of the elites regardless of race or religion to take over the world and everything that has happened amp been happening the buying off of politicians elite friendly legislation like citizens united people like bill gates buying up massive amounts of farmland as well as the billionaires buying luxury underground bunkers and survival estates in places like new zealand does bear that out i do believe in vaccine injury note my screen name i been left on permanently disability by so called safe vaccines and every additional vaccine i got from birth to age i finally connected the dots wised up and stopped getting further deteriorated my health caused more and more medical issues and so i believe that vaccines should be a private amp personal choice that each person is free to make based on their own health history and co existing issues genetic vulnerabilities amp family history and risk level and that vaccines should never be mandatory i also do believe that vaccines are one of the tools that the elites are already or will be using in the future for control i believe fluoride is a toxin and should not be used i do necessarily believe in chemtrails however i can not say definitively either way as have not really looked much into it since i am more interested in vaccine injury issues especially as that involves me directly i do believe jeffrey epstein killed himself i think he was silenced to keep him from revealing incriminating information about his ties to the clintons to trump and to numerous other highly powerful amp influential public figures i do believe pizzagate is real i do believe that there a bunch of lizard people running around disguised as world leaders i do believe that sandy hook or any of the other mass shootings were faked or that the victims were crisis actors i do not believe the official narrative of the jfk assassination i think lee harvey oswald was a patsy for jfk murder the same way that james earl ray was proven in court to be a patsy for mlk jr murder i think that jfk assassination was orchestrated by george hw bush and people in the cia and elsewhere the banking world the growing military industrial complex etc because jfk was planning to repeal the federal reserve act and use greenback currency instead of the debt based private federal reserve bank currency as well massively downsize the cia and elements in these agencies did not want that so jfk was assassinated and the power influence of both the cia and the fed has massively ballooned even more since then i do necessarily believe in aliens life on other planets or ufos but by the same token i do dismiss the possibility outright either i do necessarily believe in the existence of bigfoot but again i do dismiss the possibility outright either i do necessarily believe in god but like the previous two points i do dismiss the possibility outright either i am a secular humanist anti theist who wavers between agnosticism and atheism but thinks organized religions are a man made scourge on society that only creates senseless conflict war and separations divisions and all of the money time energy amp resources that are wasted on religion could be put to so much better use eradicating poverty cleaning up the environment saving wildlife and other needy animals stray cats amp dogs etc and otherwise improving the world any other questions
how do you not in a group of more than scientists from countries named climate change an emergency that would lead to untold human suffering if no big shifts in action take place after pretty safe to assume we not on pace to make major changes those kids are fucked
nan
the lifecycle emissions are on par with wind or nuclear and generally lower than solar though the issue here is local pollution rather than emissions and climate change oh and it much more expensive than fossil fuels particularly biogas without subsidy
as jfk once said we do it not because it easy but because it hard it be nice if we could easily reverse climate change but we doing over a century of work in our life time the payout may not be in our life time but for the future of all man kind
the climate has constantly been changing since the earth formed an atmosphere there have been multiple ice ages a major one as recently as years ago you ca just point at weather events and paint them with a brush as broad as climate change unfortunately
just because some people perceive something as a big issue does not mean it is example peopel think the scientific debate over weather or not climate change is human induced is a critical issue but the reality is that this scientific debate does not even exist its purely a political debate
exactly you do care about climate change which is why the rest of the world will never take you or trump or any republican seriously
he address climate change trump would
look around the us right now we dealing with christofascists what you said about the maga crowd is true and i not denying it but that a recent problem and the older form of christianity has a different problem even more even it not that universal a white evangelicals see trump as fighting for their beliefs though many have mixed feelings about his personal done by the pew research shows that although admittedly a minority says that trump is not that morally upstanding and says that trump does not fight what they believing in for some stances like plandemic conspiracy and global warming denialism this can be explained better from their political affiliation for the plandemic conspiracy this can be shown by a vaccines evangelicals by the stat news they reported that black evangelical church are less hesitant towards vaccine than the white evangelical church and black evangelical church is more likely to be democrat than a white evangelical similarly another religion and views on climate and energy by the pew research shows that white evangelical is more likely than black evangelical to deny climate change i think for abortion stance it probably similar as black evangelical also leans more into pro choice religion religious landscape study religious tradition historically black protestant views about but for the last one i admit i lack better evidence also you lumping christianity trump extremist sure there is such tendency but again not universal and the correlation is better assigned to the political alignment anyway yeah but only one of them worships a god of war who resorted to genocide and slavery at the drop of a hat non abrahamic versions of christianity rejected the god of war abrahamic christianity embraced him you realize that that god of war is supposed to the same god as the judaism god right by the same logic the jews are a violent people no i do think jews are violent i just using a proof of contradiction also put muslims norse paganism hindu etc in the same picture worshipping a war god or having a war oriented religion is to be expected in a religion originated from a war torn nation then did i say that what matter is how their cult view their own god not what the other cult says you ca apply the doctrine of christianity to judge what a laveyan satanist pray to satan in that religion symbolized noncomformity and rebellion against the dominant system not a god that allows them to do many vices they are have you ever discussed the war crimes in the tanakh with them i have numerous times they fully support and defend them in practice they wo do so brazenly especially in place where i lived indonesia they might justify them by a change of law from the old testament to the new testament or because god allowed them to do that the extremist does not have god permission or because the people there was evil which is an inconsistent belief i know that very much but shows more about the flexibility of the religion look over the history of christianity does it look like the religion of a god of war or a god of love i know the history of crusade and religious persecution you do need to teach me about me and i not claiming that christian god is a god of love either i just claim that the christian values depends on the social mores of the members at the time the church that served black people obviously did not appeal to white supremacy because that would be counterproductive to the existence of the black church also historically catholicism did actions that is over the place with respect of the antisemiticism on the one hand they believed in jewish deicide something that modern catholicism retract and there is also persecution in some areas where jews are forced to convert or suffer from death penalty on the other hand catholicism often made an action protecting jews like how pope callixtus ii issued sicut judaeis which forbade forced jew conversion on pain of excommunication on the flip side other popes like pope paul iv oppressed the jews
individual carbon footprint it was all part of a fossil fuel propaganda campaign created to downplay their role in climate change and was used to shift the blame to the consumer here a great informative video please watch if you can your carbon footprint is a scam second
i ca tell if you joking or you actually being serious internalised shilling what the hell does that even mean you seem to have a major issue accepting that people disagree with you without some conspiracy being behind it there is no evidence supporting that it safe you completely ignoring the wide scientific consensus on gm the scientific community completely disagrees with you entirely there are thousands of peer reviewed studies on gm with not a single one showing any evidence of harm seriously how does someone get to the point where they willingly deny the science in front of them it like watching a republican say climate change is real
ok but do act like you care about climate change though
this is taken from what another user posted uh did you look it up yourself or did you read some other person opinion on it that aligned with your political leaning i reading it now and by reading it now i mean i reading all the supports it says to endorse commit to including the charlevoix commitment on equality and economic growth charlevoix commitment on innovative financing for development charlevoix common vision for the future of artificial intelligence charlevoix declaration on quality education for girls adolescent girls and women in developing countries charlevoix commitment to end sexual and gender based violence abuse and harassment in digital contexts charlevoix commitment on defending democracy from foreign threats charlevoix blueprint for healthy oceans seas and resilient coastal communities charlevoix blueprint for healthy oceans seas and resilient coastal communities and the gender equality advisory council it also mentions a commitment to replenishing the global fund by a the cost which could range from billion to over the year period now either this is toothless and meaningless in which case trump not signing is meaningless or if it would have been meaningful it meaningful that he did sign it then presumably that would mean not only signing but following through on the zillions of commitments i reading now there are tons of initiatives in there you can read all the documents en official there are plenty of politically charged affirmations and initiatives that nobody who represents the nation should commit to on behalf of all their voters just for a toothless and meaningless agreement that would nonetheless get his signature of affirmation especially when the argument on the right is that just because someone might personally feel they themselves would do or say or affirm something that it not the role of government to take these actions on behalf of everyone i mean support removing gender biases in the development of digital platforms and connected technologies from design to end use what if the tables were turned and it said something like support educating single impoverished mothers about the sanctity of the unborn child and the financial assistance available to them for choosing to not kill their babies people ca have it both ways either this was meaningless in which case who cares if he signed it or it is meaningful and all the programs listed inside should be given organizational and financial commitment under the charlevoix blueprint for healthy oceans seas and resilient coastal communities annex ocean plastics charter includes a lot of program and initiative oriented assertions which interestingly there a footnote in this document that reads the united states strongly supports healthy oceans seas and resilient coastal communities the united states has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement and reserves on the climate related language in the blueprint hinting at the whole issue in the first place there are sections of the document that would include assertions and consequent actions that have far reaching implications for people whether they voted for the person signing this or not on industry policy etc people elect an executive in the american system to execute the laws and programs that are enacted by congress there nowhere in the constitution that says the president can then go off and start agreeing to broad ranging commitments again is it meaningful or not that people did vote for section coastal and shoreline action subsection accelerating implementation of the leaders action plan to combat marine litter through the regional seas programs initiatives led by rfmos where appropriate and targeted investments for clean up activities that prove to be environmentally sound in global hotspots and priority areas in particular on abandoned lost or otherwise discarded fishing gears aldfg and wastes generated and collected by fishery activities what does that even mean in terms of action and now i have to read the leaders action plan to combat marine litter pulls it up surprise far more initiatives these are free subsection from that under responsible investment and sustainable agriculture we commit to promoting best practices for adaptation to climate change and take note of new initiatives the global alliance for climate smart agriculture what that they appear to be a un think tank on best practices like the passage implies however looking through the briefs they published among classic hits like manure helps feed the world and solar powered irrigation systems is a gender responsive approach to climate smart agriculture now what is contained in this document the following statement gender equality implies equal participation of women and men in decisionmaking equal ability to exercise their human rights equal access to and control over resources now on the surface this seems like a noble statement and our conception of equal opportunity the problem is that these types of sentiments have been twisted into if it not it the sexist patriarchy at work and this is just one of a seemingly infinite set of branching implications because if the president signed this document he is saying that he affirms he will promote that gender equality is equal participation in decision making and control over resources think about the category of that statement politically and whether people would be so keen for him to make that commitment if the statement was one they disagreed with the twists of i know it seems like a complicated argument when i start running through the details but it not a simple document and the essential argument is simple either this is a meaningless document in which why sign it and why does it matter that he did sign it or the meaningfullness does come from how toothy it is but that if he did sign it he implement it right well the document is as simple as the first read it includes extensions of affirmations and commitments to a chain of documents some of which obama signed that he may be opposed to or campaigned against and that plenty of people fundamentally do agree with the construction of that makes these types of commissions and policy actions undemocratic and unwise
you might here a lot of bullshit tonight but here there reasoning my father is a buttigeg supporter and the way he puts it it very understandable he socially liberally pro minority rights pro planned parenthood pro common sense gun control but fiscally he leans conservative he a year old man who works a blue collar job and he and wants to retire as soon as he can he not for a drastic change in our tax policy it safe to say a large majority of bernie supporters are either millennials or gen zers who know that even if their taxes go up they can take it because in the long run it will improve their chances of getting into the middle or upper middle class boomers and gen xers like my father do want a revolution not this late in their lives if you over the age of been working at your job long enough to where you have full time and benefits and some how you made into the middle class bernie revolution seems to you like it may hinder your progress rather than help my dad not an idiot he knows climate change is real he knows billionaires are taking advantage of both the working and shrinking middle class but for those who have retirement in their next major goal in life well they feel more attracted to a moderate who will fight for social issues make our economy more green and does plan on more taxes these people are like hey let pick gay obama this time they simply are interested in a total uproot in the system this late in their lives that why buttigeg supporters tend to be older than their bernie counterparts bernie is the seed in the ground we will see bloom in our lifetimes boomers not so much than older you are the more hesitant you are to change it that simple
originally yes but it became politicized and revisionist the moment activists took it name and the reasons why there is such pushback is because of the latter not the former it the same situation that happened with climate change science the science is legit but most of the activism using it name is unscientific and obtrusive
hello mgtow user who calls women cheating cunts so nice of you to wander over to this subreddit i sure you have valuable and in good faith things to say here i sure you would come here and post images of articles published in the washington but have those images edited so it harder to tell that the source is a climate change denying white supremacy promoting conspiracy theory advocating wiki right
climate change
context a federal politician criticised the students saying that activism does belong in the classroom and that they will all end up jobless unintelligent and on welfare this sign was in response to those comments i also spotted one that said why should we go to school if you wo listen to the educated link to article federal climate change protest will lead to dole queue minister tells edit the pm scott morrison made similar comments however this particular article is about resources minister matt canavan
a new study combining astronomical and geologic data hints at an extraterrestrial cause for extreme climate change million years ago
what is the motive behind all those climate skeptics who respond angrily to almost every article on climate change published on the internet they do seem to have a vested interest in the fossil fuel industry that obviously has its own agenda nor do they routinely raise any objections regarding the validity of scientific research in relation to other serious environmental issues such as pollution land degradation or loss of habitat it is only on the subject of climate change that they feel the need to denigrate the entire body of research whilst failing to provide any credible scientific evidence for their counter claims even if they are just uninformed members of the public what is it about this particular issue that annoys them so much common sense tells us that humans ca keep trashing the planet indefinitely and recklessly consuming non renewable resources without calamitous consequences down the track so why would they not want the world to act now rather than wait until maximum damage has occurred for the life of me i ca understand where they coming from
a sticker that had been made depicting greta thunberg the young woman who has been trying to sound the alarm about climate change being literally subjected to a sexual assault so fucking gross
i agree humans are destroying this planet the world moans about the earth climate change but does naff all to fix it and just cause disruption
well it was a bit of a stupid point it probably would have been hard for anyone native or not to realise that burning forests would cause climate change all the way back then we are in now with far more scientific knowledge the fact that people are jumping up and down about it is because people still do think that burning our environment can change the climate it idiotic and a false equivalence
so you think they would be wealthier and happier if they all gave up on farming and started scouring the country side for scrubs and insects to eat the easier it is to farm the cheaper it is to produce food the cheaper it is to buy food every single one of us is only eating with so much abundance thanks to innovation most of us would be dead if we were reaping the health and educational benefits among many others that we have gained the workers are poor right they need things right that is work building toilets making food every item that people want or need is potential work do you honestly think people were richer healthier and happier when they were cavemen we were the only notion i will entertain is with all this power we do a lot of damage to ecosystems including our own earth is not dying but climate change could lead to many of us dying though we would be here in the first place without innovation and solving that problem is going to require more innovation think about what innovation is innovation is a humans ability to problem solve it intelligence you are saying that intelligence leads to poverty but you could be further from the truth
some of the literal oldest living things on drought bark beetles oldest have died due to manmade climate change who wants to bring new humans into this shit show
its not their fault they suffer from both convenient political amnesia and illogicalitis someday they likely blame climate change and trump getting elected on the dems
i feel for the young fucking climate change is getting worse and worse that whole house on fire and everything is fine is to real for this god damned planet fuckin governments outlawing and breaking up climate protests is fuck they are fighting for a future that they wo get oh and come migrations to more habitats zones those fascist fucks are gon na go beserk and probably resort to violence in defense of whatever country they live in most if those counts prob do even care about the world being on fire as they privileged as fuck humans are the worst
buy shares in tesla and kick musk out like he did with the original owners and turn it into a producer of hydrogen cars at the same price as petrol cars or cheaper if production costs allow it because i actually care about preventing the consequences of climate change lobby against the fossil fuel industry and military industrial complex lobby to force amazon to delete it amazon prime service and force them to transport the sold goods by train or boat idc if your purchase takes longer to arrive you were able to survive before same day shipping became a thing
trending on twitter is why she been chosen she started a movement within this generation of children and inspired potentially millions of people to focus more on climate change she spoken to children adults even world leaders about why climate change is the most important thing to be focusing on and it was heard by many even if it was ignored by others as well her being chosen over the hong kong protesters does mean anything negative about the protesters by the way both matters are incredibly important
from the pov of seeing all of them trying to band together not so much idk it not like anyone ever is without flaw i love watching characters work together and progress despite their flaws there are theories that the white walkers are a metaphor for climate change wot
northern ontario is bigger than the state of texas with a population considerably less than just the gta and a climate that is less than salubrious several months of the year no amount of government policy is going to change that and by the by who the hell do you think is paying for the electricity market in northern ontario who paid to electrify the north in the first place
thanks my main concern in both locations is the cost of living change if i get the job in seattle i will be paid pretty well and have union membership but honestly seattle and portland have been top two on my list for some time cooler climate less red etc
unless i mistaken they ca sue for anything that cuts into their profits only if a country breaches the treaty and that breach causes a company to lose profits banning a dangerous product would breach the treaty as long as the product is also banned domestically the countries are signing the treaty so it important to hold them accountable in my opinion as for the climate change argument i no lawyer but a transition to a low emissions economy sounds like a good start to me malaysia participating is probably one of the best things about the agreement in my opinion think of all the impoverished people that would get steady jobs as a result human trafficking and slavery is a part of every country history and this agreement would be a good step toward getting those people decent lives
not much look at climate change
well obama did really make disparaging comments about an entire gender these women felt disrespected by his comments rightfully so how would you feel if obama had made demeaning comments about your race gender reduced you to your lower common denominator also these women were protesting not just about abortion that a very narrow view i would argue that was the minority they were supporting causes that mattered to marriage equality climate change stopping racism etc
i not a conservative so i going to eschew all the reasons that i do like trump that are based on policy i think a lot of conservative policy is wrong and almost all of the gop policy is wrong but trump is different here why wildly dishonest he lies about small things and big things his entire administration is built on lies explaining his lies justifying his lies many think it some grand strategy to distract the russian firehouse tactic some doublespeak he perfected but i do think so i think it compulsive and gotten worse less slick as he ages and loses faculties and it functions as doublespeak russian firehose tactic is apparently entirely without morals or decency this goes way response to was to say that his building was now the tallest he also lied and said that he was down there clearing rubble he did not do that and later applied and got small biz fund relief he started that fraud university to bilk desperate people out of their money which is truly ugly because those folks were trying to better themselves when puerto rico whom he is president of is hit with a disaster he shits on them about money his charities are fake often not giving way any of his money or any money at all he promises to make donations and then does there are countless stories of him behaving cruelly or inappropriately as a human in terms of caring or empathizing let me be clear i not saying he necessarily a sadist who likes the pain of others but he is very clearly someone who does not empathize with other human beings in even a minimally human way is anti intellectual incurious dumb is not the right word i doubt he below average intelligence but he really is someone who took being tall and born rich and built an entire life on the premise that image is everything he uninformed about a lot he thinks being informed is a waste of time and it shows for example many in the gop deny climate change and i think that dumb but trump does even understand it he ca steelman shit he distorts and lies about his opposition positions which i hate in a redditor in a president jesus unpatriotic liberals are known as flag wavers i sure ai i revolted by the idea of reflexive america is the best chanting but we are supposed to be a team are we the fact is trump and his team are proven to have had contacts with the russians proven were offered help in the election proven and said they would like help proven a dozen of our intelligence agencies said that russia attacked our elections and interfered but trump stands next to putin and says he believes putin our intel says that they going to interfere again trump and putin get on the phone and talk for minutes but no mention of putin ongoing attack on our democracy why because trump knows that putin is cheating for him and since he dishonest without morals and does care about democracy he happy about it repugnant the things listed among others but outside of how i feel about supply side economics and abortion are why donald trump is an awful human being if you say well i like the policies owning the libs so i do care then i think you like a sizeable amount of the gop and i think that awful but you are alone but i do see how you deny that what i wrote is true
welcome to the concept of climate change
i sure my comment will get buried but climate change will disproportionately impact the higher latitudes poles melting ice caps changing currents and the tropic zones direct exposure to sunlight coupled with deforestation is causing rapid desertification polar region warming is causing animals and insects to either die out or move south in search of food the tropical latitudes are quickly becoming uninhabitable as locals lose the ability to farm hunt and fish both human and non human life are beginning to migrate to lands that can still support life the environmental impacts of this kind of migration could be absolutely devastating as it threatens to overload ecosystems which already struggle due to current usage and pollution while something like a wall might be able to keep humans out it certainly wo stop birds fish and insects for example which have the potential to destroy an ecosystem that is equipped for this kind of migration switching to a plant based diet is the first thing we all need to do right now the commercialized meat dairy and egg industry is responsible for about of greenhouse gas emissions world document sharing these emissions are not just methane from the livestock they come from deforestation land conversion loss of natural carbon sinks livestock feed production growing shipping ect meat packaging freezing shipping and so on another point i like to make is that we need to start pushing for meat alternatives such as lab grown and meat substitutes that taste exactly like as it has the potential to be eco friendly when executed correctly meat eating and food in general is a huge part of many cultures around the world and i do think it would be fair to deprive people of this i know a lot of people do like the idea of abstaining from consuming animals and animal products but it something we must do right now only until we develop an alternative if we want to mitigate climate change here is a link to a google document sharing containing the information below along with a comprehensive list of subreddits you can join to get more info about sustainable and environmentally friendly living no rain drop thinks it responsible for the flood food eat less meat dairy and other animal products none is the best eat less industrially produced food less processed food less packaged foods for example bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated and produces plastic waste so drink tap water eat proper portion sizes remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment so adopt do shop to discourage their production and try to choose pets that are herbivores avoid palm oil aside from food it is also a common ingredient in other products for example soaps and washing powders energy drive less cycle and walk as much as possible avoid flying use efficient light bulbs turn the lights off when you not in the room unplug devices when not in use to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet some are very cheap insulate your home do warm or cool the rooms more than necessary adjust your clothes first criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much forgo living in a single family house in favor of apartment style housing that way more people get to live on less land sharing walls is more energy efficient commutes are shorter etc use solar every where you can solar lights are relatively inexpensive and work great do be afraid of nuclear power plants waste avoid items with too much packaging do buy more than you need but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging buy recyclable items q tips with paper stick instead of plastic bamboo toothbrushes etc recycle avoid single use items do use disposable cutlery and cups disposable wipes disposable plastic bags if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons etc contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging do not buy glitter or anything that contains glitter clothing make up junk that you hang on a christmas tree water do flush the toilet when not necessary do throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids and toilet paper no cotton pads no q tips no floss no tampons no cigarette butts no paper towels turn the water off while you are lathering brushing your teeth etc cut down on showers and baths do water your lawns try to plant local plants that do need watering reproduction use birth control and encourage others to use it limit your family size to no more than two children none is best please consider adoption before having your own children activism encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle feel free to share this list donate money to environmental charities be careful who you vote for pressure your representatives and politicians support carbon sequestration technology source atmospheric science major studying air pollution and how it fucking up the planet edit fixed a sentence this got more attention than i thought i ca answer each reply so i update this i see a lot of people have some anxiety about lifestyle changes and the idea that generations today are essentially stuck cleaning up after previous generations see my response to this many of you have brought up systemic issues which prevent the lifestyle changes mentioned in the list above i agree our current economic and government systems do not work when we consider the environment it should go without saying that these systems will also need to start changing if we are to address climate problems i not a political scientist or an economist so i have no idea what that might look like but i do understand that this wo just happen because we bitch about it on reddit we need to make sure our leaders hear these concerns which is why i emphasize voting and contacting policy makers some ecologists and climate scientists have proposed that the problem of climate change is not necessarily our lifestyles but the fact that so many people are living the way we do decreasing the population would also decrease emissions garbage and land use on the other hand other scientists believe we can continue to populate exponentially as long as we reduce pollution and use advances in tech and science to mitigate climate change while maintaining our lifestyles i happen to be a pluralist when it comes to this issue right now humanity avoids addressing climate change because we afraid of the lifestyle changes personally i do believe we have to change very much we can still eat and we can still live comfortable lives we do need to find an alternative for as this is destroying ecosystems around the i also think we need to seriously start pressuring entities that own large buildings in metro areas to upgrade things like insulation and install automatic light sensors the business sector uses a lot of energy on heating and pdf assessment report pdf warning but this can easily be curbed when older buildings are updated the empire state building in nyc was recently renovated and upgraded to be energy efficient and the building now uses less esb sustainability project changes like this would reduce the amount of energy we wiki and we be giving up nothing we can also do this in our homes which will lower utility bills someone mentioned resources education and positive negative feedback yes these are huge problems albedo is one issue that i am particularly interested in researching just because we do have a solution this very second does mean we wo in a year or years or years perhaps tackling climate change is going to be easy and it not going to happen overnight but with each step humanity takes we give ourselves more time on the back end if we start with conservation such as the building renovations mentioned above and cutting down on plastic waste we will slow the overall warming giving us additional time to address the more challenging issues such as feedback systems there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered but i love the discussion all have sparked here over the last few years we gone from climate change is real to how do we solve the problems that are created when we address climate change i think this is great i implore anyone reading this to keep discussing these problems with family friends online with your employer and with local and national leaders discussion is how we find solutions
but economic competition is driven by commerce and free exchange of ideas you ca have massive companies like these censoring ideas in order to steer the global economy toward their goal and not call that economic competition their entire directive is to change the economic climate to suit their desires and they do this through censorship astroturfing and pushing their social agenda to appear as if it the only one
this painting these natural disasters as indicators that climate change is an imminent threat will only serve to hasten changes to legislation that will improve the environment we need to be selective of stories that motivate us to reverse climate change honestly you think it was the end of the world with these people edit omg this was ironic on purpose guys i was joking
boom chernobyl what do you think will happen when countries with less money than france and japan will bank on nuclear and will inevitably cut corners when it comes to security like in chernobyl it will make a big boom the best solution to global warming is reducing our consumption btw it global warming not climate change that would be great if the climate was changing again and again bu it keeps getting warmer and that the problem it wo change back before a millenium
this is the first bad bushfire season in australia and it wo be the last years like this happen every decade or two of course climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of bushfires but australia has always had them and they are a natural part of the ecosystem i would let that turn you off a move to australia for a lot of the generation of aussies on reddit this is probably their first experience of a really bad fire year since we are in the first really significant drought now since the millennium drought and fire management and control is a lot better now than it used to be but stuff like this has always happened in australia not to downplay it or anything it definitely one of the worst years on record but you never going to be able to prevent occasional devastating bushfire years in australia
of course there no possible way that those defects are caused by something else that was introduced recently i ca quite put my finger on it nah must be climate change
it almost like he trying to pad his resume so that when he gets the boot in the next election as he unquestionably will he can land some cushy public sector job in the climate change field
i hope he does somehow turn this coal thing into a discussion about climate change in bernie response
this is just like climate change if someone gets shot in europe fucking idiots get on reddit and claim that it somehow makes the usas insane death rate from guns suddenly ok derp it was cold today global warming is real derp a guy got shot so gun laws are useless
hey no they did the supreme court heard arguments on what is appealable and what is jurisdiction seeking behavior by large companies it could be an important case but the supreme court wo decide anything at all about climate change or whether the suit can be brought
tell him he a moron when it comes to climate change and he should stick to his area of expertise
if trump does believe we need to do anything about climate change why would he seek a better deal
it alot better than using wind turbines and solar panels and again with weather those solar panels and turbines are fucking useless so much for green tech and yeah it does if you were paying attention obviously you were it clear you did catch my meaning at all do you know what the mariana trench is do you know how deep the mariana trench is i do think you do i do know where you going with this mining and building a trench shit still does change the fact that asteroid hit with million megatons of tnt if that does visualize how little destructive power we actually have that on you not me but it obviously you and again i arguing the john calhoun effect is worse than climate change you did even bother proving otherwise thing again focusing our effects to environment is indeed an emotional reaction ironic
yes i have long said this the only thing scarier than the far right denying climate change is them accepting it
i for anything that might reduce climate change
normal patterns are being shifted and disrupted no the prediction is that it will again predictions predictions predictions that s all it is none of the predictions that large paterns will shift came true noth pole gone by no not even close does mean its not melting and it will be gone if we continue maybe yeah i know this is cherry picking but show me some of the predictions in this caliber that came true again they might be conservative in their own way but still they are overblown when you compare it to empirical data from the last years maybe its time to change the tactic and instead of trying to prove how bad climate change is we should go back to acutally try to predict how big climate change is because we are very shit at it apperantly also because it is political and predictions were kind of very far off its very easy to deny the climate change as a whole for political purposuses for instance because the evidence is there that they were wrong so what a lot of right wing politicans say that it wrong as a whole and people blindly follow that because the ipcc were actually wrong but that does nt mean there is no climate they do nt know that and because almost on the left admits this there will not be a middle ground for a real solution left and right a bit unuanced but you get what i mean i think but please keep promoting this alarmism
climate change is occurring for a reason it is occurring because the owners of fossil fuel industries care more about maximizing profit than they do about long term sustainability in all industries profit comes first and sustainability comes second whether it with planned obsolescence in tech companies like apple or with the fossil fuel industry and because profit comes before sustainability climate change and its related deaths destruction and chaos are endemic to the capitalist system it becoming increasingly apparent that our planet is at a crisis point in the next century climate change has the potential to destroy our civilization and since climate change is endemic to capitalism the only way to ensure the long term survival of our species is to build a system where production is owned and democratically controlled by the people where human needs and sustainability are recognized and viewed with the utmost importance and where the profit motive is abolished a liberal capitalist approach to climate change will get us nowhere attempts have been made to lessen the impact of climate change before like the kyoto protocol but these measures do go nearly far enough because going too far would be detrimental to the profits of the businessmen who control the politicians that make these decisions if capitalism persists for more than a few decades longer there is a very real possibility that human civilization and society will collapse that hundreds of thousands of plant and animal species could go extinct and that billions of lives will be lost now more than ever the phrase written by rosa luxemburg a century ago rings true socialism or barbarism

the great derangement climate change and the unthinkable amitav ghosh can change your life
using that phrase just makes you sound dumb believe in climate change people who use phrases like that do think very deeply they are merely team members fighting for their team if team progressive had decided to push global cooling instead that the buzzword we see repeated ad nauseum by the foot soldiers
they not obligated to spend their money on ending climate change they private citizens they are however obligated to pay their taxes and create safe fair and well paying working conditions which they are not doing
this seems neutral and without bias you can tell because there is not a single negative assigned to ds just like real life anybody that refuses to vote for team d must therefore me an idiot first of all i am biased strongly i like health care ergo i like the party that has expanded health care i like the minimum wage ergo i like the party that created the american minimum wage and have raised it out of times i care about the environment ergo i like the party that acknowledges the science of climate change hell yeah i biased i biased the same way that a weight lifter is biased toward meals with lots of protein if you want to build muscle it wo help you to eat ten pounds of lettuce after a workout or in the case of republicans drinking bleach as for the negatives all of the candidates have them but none have been a big enough deal for me to vote against my own best interests joe biden said the words urban jungle do care he wants a hr minimum wage and the words urban jungle pale in comparison to trump trying to postpone the election and blowing up the economy hillary clinton once uttered super predator do care she wanted universal health care and the words super predator pale in comparison to trump raping his wife and promising to bomb civilians overseas barack obama could keep his promise about you keeping your doctor care a little bit but he still managed to give health insurance to million uninsured americans if you like your doctor you can keep them pales in comparison to mitt romney promising to repeal the aca whole cloth obama mentioned people clinging to their guns and religion do care he campaigned on rebuilding the economy and expanding health care people clinging to their guns and religion pales in comparison to john mccain fucking joking about starting a war with iran not taking climate change seriously and nominating an airhead for vp you want to know why i did list negatives for the democrats because it fucking trivial compared to the damage done by republicans what am i supposed to get my panties in a knot about no none of the democrats in my lifetime have been perfect none ever will be no political candidate will ever be perfect because they all humans and humans are imperfect that said even with those imperfections each of those democratic candidates would have been better for my country than the republican alternative was i absolutely believe that when republicans acknowledge that climate change is a real threat or that government spending is good for the economy or that the minimum wage helps people then maybe i consider voting for them but right now and for the past forty years no republican has talked about taking our nation in the direction i want and we need our nation to go in
i do buy democrats being able to put anyone on the supreme count is all likelihood republicans will block any nomination till they are back in the white house not if we vote for democrats in enough numbers even in that case a supeme court with members is preferable to one with another far right ideologue i do see any actual plan coming out of biden camp for accomplishing prison reform free two year or a minimum wage increase until i see some concrete legislation on this i have zero faith biden will expend political capital to get it done or not laiden the system down with so many austerity measures the programs become useless those are his actual stated positions though that is a significant difference trump stated positions are terrible stating that you do believe in biden actual positions seems like you just trying to justify your belief that they identical in the face of actual evidence to the contrary carbon taxes do nothing to fight the root causes of climate change they do even act as a speed bump and will do nothing to stop environmental catastrophe carbon taxes make emitting more expensive that will absolutely reduce emissions it not as good as we could do but it a hell of a lot better than trump support of coal and rolling back emissions fuel economy standards his plan for expanding the aca is a joke that wo help an meaningful amount of people and again any amount of expansion of the aca is better than dismantling it hell just restoring it to where it was under obama would be an improvement from where we are now much less where we would be under another years of trump no it is perfect but improvement is still a worthwhile goal again our only two options are trump and biden at this point one of them will slightly improve american healthcare one will throw it in a fire and piss on the ashes that seems like a pretty easy choice to me given biden track record of deregulation and corporate servitude i ca see a biden tax plan doing anything other than increasing the amount of money going to the top as with above this seems like you just ignoring his stated positions because you already decided you do want to vote for him however he lays out his plan very clearly on his policy page as president biden will roll back the trump rate cut for the very wealthy and restore the top rate the biden plan will assure those making over million will pay the top rate on capital gains doubling the capital gains tax rate on the super wealthy he wants to increase capital gains from to for income over mm and also roll back the trump reduction of the top tax bracket is the same as the top bracket was under obama you could accuse him of lying i suppose but even then someone who tries to appeal to people who want increased taxes is preferable to someone who openly courts corporations and that taking the most cynical possible view if you doubt me that quote is from the last paragraph
why not you are among the countries first in line to get fucked by climate change with another four years of trump and bolsonaro this planet has a snowball chance in hell
bernie considers global warming the most timely change to national security he opposed the building of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a notable effect on the climate bernie bot
a non living thing driven by the decisions of concious beings can though and who is driving climate change
there is the potential here for the ndp to face a big choice just like they did in back in paul martin had organized a national daycare plan with buy in from every province meanwhile conservative stephen harper the man most likely to replace martin in the event of the election was firmly against it and pushing tax credits that favored the already wealthy given the chance to use the martin minority government to achieve it stated policy goals the ndp instead decided to defeat the government over the sponsorship scandal something martin was not even involved in in the following election harper came to power and stayed for a decade setting back progress on childcare climate change lgbt rights reconciliation and a host of other policy issue the ndp cares about that a loss for progressive and liberal policy no matter how you slice it i hope the ndp makes a better choice this time and opts to move their policy goals forward
the world is full of antivaxers flatearthers climate change deniers alien abductees et al the time for miscommunications occurring due to jokes and sarcasm is over
if you have already and you truly care about climate change then go vegan or at least mostly plant based
oh yeah completely agree and was the same in my city it was amazingly cleaner and the ambient noise dropped too but people wo change their lives so dramatically for climate change we have to pull a bait and switch instead like i a vegetarian for most my life but many people especially older generation wo change their diet for climate change just need to raise the cost of meat and watch consumption go down due to pricing
that climate change analogy was really great to help me get a grip on how things may have been viewed thanks
on the comforting side if you look through a list of mass extinction events in the fossil record magnetic reversals are not a likely cause of any of them and there have been hundreds of reversals and also climate change is on the list so in that sense we got something to be way more worried about on the other hand as you point out the dinosaurs did have satellite infrastructure
exhibit climate change
well since it too late to do anything about climate change then coastal areas will flood leaving us with less food for a growing population also in this time fossil feuls will become a rarity wars over fossil fuels along with a starving population will cause our country to lose a number of the population eventually america will either become an area of civil war between the states or a post apocalyptic society
do you not realise you arguing scientific results with personal opinion the same manner climate change deniers do studies humans are worsening climate change with utmost certainty random internet commenter i argue that climate changes by itself with zero proof i as atheist as it gets anti religious even but science is science
true also i did nt meant to say vegans are not normal i meant the people who does nt even necessarily believe in say climate change and recycling
large swings in demand are hard to compensate for especially with renewables not as much of an issue right now since most of our production is still fossil fuel based but if we ever want to have a mostly renewable grid then it be quite a large issue even today only is renewable and a pretty big challenge to balance excess energy is completely uneconomical to store exporting it is ideal but realistically places like the uk will have similar wind profiles to us so when we produce a lot so will neighbouring countries we can waste it dump it or curtail generators but that very uneconomical not in the numbers on a spreadsheet sense but in the massively inefficient use of resources sense the plan is to produce a massive excess of renewable energy having a high base load will help balance so if we do have to compensate with storage we have avenues to use that storage quickly without risking exceeding storage capacity and will always have somewhere that needs a lot of energy especially useful at night when it tends to be windiest and swings in demand up to peak demand will be a smaller percentage of minimum demand if we have a lot of baseload there is the argument that lowering consumption is the only way to deal with climate change but shifting data centres to another country which probably has a less green grid does actually solve anything on that front if you think no country should take it up then you better be willing to pick up a gun for some sort of socialist eco fascist revolution i think being anti data centre is short sighted and ireland should embrace its planned position as the oil country equivalent of the future we give out about politicians only planning for the next election cycle but people here are only planning for their next bill
they are the same thing before you start so hearty call people idiots sometimes it is also nice that you educate yourself global warming global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire earth since the early century and most notably since the late due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions since the industrial revolution worldwide since the average surface temperature has gone up by about c f relative to the century baseline of climate change climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels which add heat trapping gases to earth atmosphere these phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming but also encompass changes such as sea level rise ice mass loss in greenland antarctica the arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide shifts in flower plant blooming and extreme weather events climate change is the drive of the issue global warming can be considered as a side effect from climate change but no they are not the same thing claiming otherwise or just a rebrand of the same thing is idiotic its like claiming that coca cola and herbal tea are the same thing because they are drinks
i would love to see a climate change ama with brian cox sure he is a physicist and not a climate expert in any sense but he is a scientist that does a lot of public appearances either explaining physics or other things he is interested in on top of that the man has a patience to rival angels
this is why it so bleak the largest economy in the world wo do anything drastic to fight climate change for at least another years
there were of these refrigerators left with their doors open years ago mc has been on a quest to close them ever since mc has finished the quest yet but with every fridge door closed the earth becomes a little warmer i bet climate change deniers would be more willing to accept that explanation
f that we going to solve climate change we just either going to solve it peacefully and diplomatically via functional governments funding a transition to clean energy and outlawing and holding to account fossil fuel companies for the destruction they caused or we going to survive climate change through violent revolution as the working class burns fossil fuel companies to the ground and decapitates several billionaires and politicians who currently feel a little too safe murdering billions with inaction
i just posted this article and it goes over the ways this campaign most certainly is racist and has racist intent i do wish to justify these attacks in any sense i condemn them completely however the french state is certainly not without blood on its hands historically recently and ongoing the history of french colonialism is pretty extensive and it continues today most former colonises are forced to make repayments for the benefits of colonialism along with a bunch of other ridiculous demands france was heavily involved in the bombing of libya in and further intervened in mali to protect its interests i have a friend who served in the french foreign legion as he said and its really no secret they just there to guard french mining corporations the country runs on the resources it continues to steal from its former colonies quite literally the fuel for it nuclear plants come from niger where the local people are not employed or compensated and the area is becoming unliveable due to radiation and climate change french racism is a random occurrence it exists to justify its continued colonial ventures
it not that there is no guarantee that the rich wo hoard the expensive local technical solutions to climate disaster it a virtual certainty that they will barring a complete overhaul of our economic system there is no dichotomy between looking towards the future and focusing on current problems as robert jensen issues good health as we adapt to climate change who gets left he has many articles by topic ecology and our articles on this we know that some human beings will adapt to what is coming what we do know is how many people will have access to the resources necessary to adapt in humane ways the different fates of affluent and ordinary people a distinction that correlates strongly with white non white during and after hurricane katrina in new orleans gives us a preview in the somewhat detached language of scholarly research this from the june issue of population and inequality has been identified as an important contributor to increasing the vulnerability of communities we should abandon any magical thinking that pretends human nature and entrenched political economic systems will change overnight and lead to global solidarity but we can continue the difficult work for social justice and ecological sustainability simultaneously not because we believe in fantasies of a world repaired but because of the need to hold on to our humanity in a broken world if we ca save the whole world we can commit to accomplishing all that can be accomplished within the limits of the real world
climate change my friends call me irma
guy an idiot no doubt i hate watching the fight videos tagged nsfl you have something less important than building security that somebody gets hit so hard for he drops and hits his head on the concrete for what looking at a stranger wrong the hard hitter did wake up wanting to commit attempted murder or give somebody brain damage yet some might argue they showing their true colors by letting their anger go that far i do know how i separate the truly sick pre meditated murderers from the people who ate cup noodles for three meals a day as a kid and ended up with anger management problems due to nutrient deficiencies what does it matter if a father or brother still ends up in a coma i condemn it either way should i hate dunno rambling aside you see two situations i guess normal fight somebody gets angry other person attempts to defuse situation anger subsides normal abnormal fight somebody gets angry other person attempts to defuse situation anger escalates to involve threats of firearms abnormal yeah it friggin extra dumb to escalate after somebody says sorry or shows their keys or whatever the defuse move is it does impress me at all though knowing a moron does want to admit he wrong he might initially tried being a legit nice batman guy defending the community but then was too proud to say oh shit my bad the colors that shows number stupid combo extra stupid with stupid on the side how the hell do i know whether this guy is an fucking egalitarian moron or a fucking racist moron what are the stats on that interracial marriage for example now has approval of newlyweds are intermarried of americans are somewhat skeptical of vaccines in jfc deny climate change ahhh there are soooo many stupid people there are a lot of racist people there is a lot of over lap but please please never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity

i hope you realize this is the exact same thing people say about feminism people can say anything you seem to be saying that because someone says it even with little supporting evidence then their opinion holds just as much weight as someone whose view has a ton of evidence it like saying climate change deniers say that scientists who say global warming is real are just lying so they can get more money for research funding and climate scientists say climate change deniers are often being funded by the fossil fuel industry so i just do know who to believe what makes you assume the disqualification of most feminism as anti men is automatic and not well thought out and based on ample evidence of the movement primary groups and representatives being openly philogynistic and vitriolic against mras because they never have any evidence other than look at what andrea dworkin wrote look what this year old on tumblr wrote see feminism hates men
because there always fear that one is wrong it obvious cyclic and it because our basic social systems and basic neural systems have changed as progressively as the number of ideas have expanded we keep dipping back into the well it basically the same type of modelling that goes on in climate change so it not like we every be satisfied with an articulated answer
pete my warren my fairly distant the primary reason is that warren lets ideology override pragmatism at times i not sure if she playing politics in those cases or sincerely believes in errant positions but either way she doing something i do like and pete does do that two specific examples are her opposition to nuclear power which could be a key part of the fight against climate change if embraced responsibly and her support for heavily taxing ammunition which is both politically stupid because it energizes the right and counterproductive as policy because it will do nothing to deter criminals but discourages responsible gun owners from practicing and becoming more proficient and safer users of their firearms the secondary reason is that pete makes government process reform voter rights gerrymandering dc statehood politicization of scotus etc a centerpiece of his campaign to a much greater extent than any other candidate and i think those reforms are critical prerequisites for most of the more ambitious things we need to do on policy that directly affects people we need to fix the broken system before we can do much of anything and pete seems to get that more than anybody else
facebook is a net negative on humanity amazon is a net positive also bezos is giving close to a billion to fight climate change
yeah that and ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ≥ÿßÿØ it has been going for a while i watched a couple of videos about how the relation of sahara and the amazon and how it possibly that the whole north africa would be complete dessert if climate change is not addressed properly this one is the to come to my mind
wish they both let go it douche bags less in the world and it good against climate change
i do think you know what you talking about most americans love france one weird campaign ad from does change that people call it the paris climate agreement because that its name
earthstrike mods need to make allow space for discussions to evolve from striking to other means of change as a platform of people we all care about making change and seeing the ecology of this planet healed i agree that we need to respect the fine line between opposing hijacking this movement and evolving growing it both are possible and we need to be able to discern between the two but let be honest about the fact that a strike will be a first step and a great hub for organizing it will not complete the task of climate remediation if that the case we need to be able to make that healthy distinction keep the movement evolving and connect this much needed strike to other positive action
i not a neo malthusian if you want this questions answered as i previously said check out the stockholm institute planetary boundaries work i will answer one of your questions about how do we know there are more resources from a perspective of fossil fuels technically there will always be fossil fuels as the earth puts them into the ground through the accumulation of fossils and dead plant life trouble is we humans like to dig out those fossil fuels for our fancy lives it took the earth hundreds of millions of years to put the oil gas and coal deep underground yet we have amazingly them into the atmosphere in the last couple of hundred years and therein is the issue we chuck them into the atmosphere about a million times faster than the earth puts them in and this goes onto to have consequences regarding ocean acidification atmospheric aerosol loading climate change chemical pollution etc

the european union commissioner on climate action and energy is looking to canada to help play the role of global environmental champion as president donald trump administration decides whether to bail on the paris climate change agreement i all in favour of combating climate change but is this really a sensible request given that we contribute something like of global greenhouse emissions canada is the country that going to make it or break it unfortunately
wonder what gorsuch thinks of those twenty or so teens that decided to sue the government over not doing anything about climate change
wrong the climate is always changing and has been since the birth of earth how do you think we got to where we are now something had to cool the planet from being a fireball in its early years and something had to melt all the ice during the ice ages of course if you ask a scientist if there is climate change they will say yes because it always been changing if you ask a scientist if humans are causing climate change and how much we are responsible for you will get a flurry of different opinions and answers that is because science is built around skepticism it a terrible word to explain how humans are changing climate and is a fear mongering tactic by politicians to gain votes because they know how broad the term is and how to abuse it kind of like what they did in the and with drugs to get elected edit i been enlightened by another commentator that the proper term would be anthropogenic climate change
hmmmm who would have thought that lying about pushing a progressive agenda would backfire on the democrats minimum wage failed protect voting rights failed address climate change with a comprehensive infrastructure bill failed they gutted every piece addressing climate change to reach a bipartisan agreement with republicans and to appease the oil barons cancel student debt probably the biggest lie of the election pushed by centrist democrats to stir support among younger and progressive wings only things they managed to deliver was one short changed stimulus check a competent covid vaccine rollout and the child tax credit keep in mind the things i complaining about ca be pinned solely on republican obstructionists we already knew they were not going to vote for any of those bills so the onus was always on the democrats to unite and get stuff done but lo and behold dinos like sinema and manchin came in and did what they do best for their real constituents the billionaires they will lose the house and possibly the senate to a combination of gerrymandering voter suppression and democratic voter apathy for failing to deliver on promises
according to the data and the overwhelming majority of scientists in relevant fields climate change has made the ca drought much much worse
well in the primary biden was my or even either although to be fair i was early on the khive train with kamala as my she really is the most liberal senator in the congress members report senate ideology beating out even sanders by one so i overjoyed with the ticket right now but let also be extremely clear here biden and harris ca snap their fingers and change the world like liberals want because we elect presidents in this country not kings the very same constitutional mechanisms that are being used to keep trump and his merry band of fascists from turning the us into a dictatorship also kept obama from really fixing things when he was president and will do the same to biden it is not the desire of democrats but limits on our power that force us into making incremental changes frustrating as that is so not unless there is a cultural sea change in terms of political parties which seems exceedingly unlikely are we going to make massive changes further when changes do happen they will not come with an orgasm of vengeance and justice porn against sociopaths instead it just becomes the new normal let me give you an example in the it was just typical to use the word gay as an insult which itself what a euphemism they themselves used for word homo and the epithet faggot the gop won massively in by scaring the public into thinking that democrats were going to gasp allow gay marriage this is how newt gingrich came to power do ask do tell was a reform considerably better than the military trying to entrap gay service personnel which is what they did before even as late as bush allowed the military to drum out badly needed gay iranian service personnel who spoke farsi and arabic and who were loyal specifically due to the way muslims murder gays but then slowly scientists started showing findings that being gay was a lifestyle or a communicable disease and even republican kids suddenly did care as i put to them at the time no skin off your nose right global climate change will be attacked the same way not when evil people are made to go away but when even evil people say i not stupid hurricanes and flooding florida is bad oh and did you check out that sweet new tesla model oh and when you get to be your dad age kids will be angrily frowning at you saying you actually rode in carbon burning cars how dare you lastly i probably closer to your dad age than yours but it is difficult to overstate my anger i more than mad at just the conservatives i also insanely angry at the hate filled left who seem bound and determined to make the nation and the world go to hell in the insane belief that this will cause a rebound to the neo communism that the us public will never allow nader the asshole doing his best to help bush become president the bernie bros doing their best to help trump all i can say is that revenge is a dish best served cold i have no doubt that in the first few years of a biden presidency there will be a large number of indictments handed down trump knows this too that why they so scared
i feel like this all started a long time ago with the science on global warming i go further and say it started with the dumbing down of america how whenever you want to say that happened defunding education moving away from science tech engineering pursuits i dunno we can show clear evidence of climate change in real time using not just data it for nerds but actual photos and video of it happening some folks are just too fucking stupid to understand it yet alone believe it and not to piss on anyone corn flakes but religion plays too large of a role in the whole thing
some is a huge understatement for america as for the rest of the world the massive scale of evangelical missionary activity funded by american ultra conservatives means a significant portion of the third world are probably either deniers or believe that climate change will bring the second coming
reddit has a very low population of climatologists and a very high population of people who think they know way more about science than they do none of the articles actually say that we are going to be dead in years they say that after the next decade or so climate change is going to become more difficult to reverse it still a very gradual process we just going to have an easier time stopping it now rather than later everything else is just dramatic phrasing look the year i was born two global superpowers were poised on the brink of annihilating the whole word with nuclear weapons everyone was sure that was going to happen by the end of the decade i mean we were sure not just it might happen sure but i ca see how we could possibly avoid this it just inevitably going to happen sure but it did despite the fact that we had built a system that was poised to destroy the world we did use it there were many times when we could have but we never did and eventually one of those superpowers crumbled and the death spiral of weapon escalation stopped peacefully and we all moved on there have been many times in history when we were sure we were going to destroy the world and we never have when humanity really really needs to we are a lot more capable of keeping our shit together than you think
all i see is absolutely abysmal human arrogance they probably thought they were so mighty for conquering such a giant tree meanwhile that tree stood there longer than their grandfather grandfather human beings like this disgust me edit downvotes for having respect for nature and calling human beings out on their arrogance honestly i consider it a badge of honor when assholes hate you you doing something right you all defending them because it was different times back then and they were only doing their jobs etc but it because of them their generation their attitude of exploitation that we all in the mess we in now when the sea levels rise and the world is in chaos when millions are starving due to climate change when your own stomachs feel the cramps of hunger just remember that you once downvoted a guy for defending a tree fucking douchebags
cool way to duck my questions i liberal too climate change is real bill burr hates on fat people
is being directly stated by high profile politicians like gavin newsom i thought i picked the most poignant part of the article can you show me where he is directly stating it the third link says climate change is contributing to the fires not starting them climate change has increased fire risk by increasing vegetation aridity what known as fuel moisture over time meaning vegetation becomes more flammable so your statement nobody is saying climate change is starting fires is incorrect so far nothing you posted has refuted it you did bother to read the material yourself
yep and he had to completely abandon any type of climate change legislation republicans and some bad dems are never gon na let that kind of stuff pass they are all in big corps pockets
my own view this is an opinionated argument i gave you factual evidence from multiple reliable sources on why climate change contributes to moving cyclones and affecting weather the reason i find it credible i can clearly see the evidence over the span of years from satellite data you want me to stop sending links from reliable sources you do want to see facts going against your opinions so far you only sent one article backing up your claims
sorry i did nt word that properly i mean that the direction of climate ca nt visibly change with in a few years it takes a very long time to observe a change in climate
not everything has to do something with climate change
would that apply to scientists and researchers who have been known to tie climate change into the most obscure research topics to improve their chances of getting grants amp funding
self centred as ever america pretty sure everyone getting shouted at about climate change you the only ones who refuse to believe that it a thing though
having edwards as the governor in the current national political situation we have found ourselves in is one of the few things that settles my nerves a bit especially now that it seems that the aca replacement will be handled largely at the state level edwards is going to have a fight on his hands if he wants to push back on climate change though
what makes you think the storms were caused by climate change when we have the coldest winter in decades it just weather but when we have a bad storm for a few days it proof that climate change is going to kill us all
perhaps you should check some members of your party history with communism and the communist party how about suggestions by your party candidate to suspend democratic processes and install a chosen technocrat government to combat climate change sounds a lot like a central authority controlling the means of production planning all policy and allocating resources for its will not the people in the name of for the people own good that is communism the greens official policy is to levy bank assets raising billions per year i work in finance this is economic idiocy we have one of the most stable banking industries in the world we have just seen what happens to countries without that the greens want to not only break our banks ability to lend money by robbing capital and killing investor confidence but raid the tills on corporations that are mostly owned by superannuation funds ie take profits from our retirements to spend now none of the rest of their policies add up they do have to balance a budget because they will never have to run one it easy to say we buy sunshine and rainbows for all when you never actually have to
that still natural selection when we are too dumb as a species nature is going to trim this failed evolutionary branch right out of existence if not with mutated viruses with climate change or who knows what other horror we in the process of unleashing if we too stupid to get on the right page about opposing those natural processes and stopping the human activity that triggers them the earth is very well equipped to fix that and has a very long history of creating the kinds of catastrophic changes that correct for imbalances and the fact that a handful of us see it coming from a mile away wo do us any good when the bulk continue to act against their own best interests we have the capacity to rise above that system but with most of us not even willing to acknowledge that we are subject to it much less wanting to devote now resources to future salvation good fucking luck
he claims that the reason we ca make progress and the right denies climate change is because the left is hysterical about it he basically blames the people who do believe in science on the people who do it ridiculous
something is going on these animals need help something it climate change and human pollution that is killing these animals and will soon be killing us wake the fuck up people
it looks like extinction news extinction rebellion group behind london climate protests moving on to next phase of a climate change activist group
in this day and age symbolism amp telling the world is more important than anything else even the action itself even if you give bucks for black amp native reparations today without the smug self gratifying attitude frothing journalists more like demagogues amp twitter mobs saying yes on every corner they will demand more reparations instead same thing with climate change a sudden legislation that bans all regular ice cars phevs amp electrics only effective immediately will spark an outrage without the pompous virtue signalling the act of greta thunberg screaming at the un is more important than the regulations itself even if you forgive all student loan debts amp introduce free college amp medicare for all immediately without the indignation that america is evil and insert authoritarian left countries praising they will still demand more the dopamine rush of righteous indignation becomes the new money
a quick back of the envelope calculation average cost of solar install x million us housing units trillion not saying this alone is climate change prevention but for the cost of the war you could put a full solar panel install on every roof in america
no mate the science is settled it is the subject of enormous amounts of studies and meta studies cross discipline including actual climate scientists nothing you say will change the you understood the science you would know why your point of view is politically exciting and scientifically ridiculous
i really think that in like years from now the emirates will stop being a desert country with plenty of trees only by siphoning water in from other places the climate itself wo change outside of the change it normally undergoes
this is the best i could make harvard scientist climate change may be worse we think reduced by i a bot climate change may not yet have had its huge impact on says schrag wait coming is really extraordinary in analyzing geologic record schrag says in the last years has been above schrag says the last time atmospheric levels spiked sharply was around million years ago when non human factors were at play likely to see maybe even degrees of warming over the next says schrag happening more than times faster than climate change experienced in the schrag believes there might be even more to be concerned about saying there might be additional factors worsening climate change that scientists have not anticipated extended r autotldr r autotldr version so far message pm and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
there wo be any society or politics to have movements unless we get a handle on climate change
sure i bite do you believe that man has any significant effect on climate change and do you believe we can stop something that occurs naturally and even has some realized benefits
oregon does have cap and trade and has way more conservative gun laws and washington barely adopted cap and trade this year and again has extremely conservative gun laws both have open carry without a permit minnesota does have cap and trade has a large amount of the population who wants to deport the states somali population and has made progress on fighting climate change so no they are not more progressive than ca
or c bernie sanders who would cause major trade wars and worldwide poverty by trying to revoke free trade plus unable to do anything effectively republican elites rule the country running us full speed ahead into climate change and eliminating roe v wade
in the age of extreme climate change building more pipelines is like spraying gas on a house on fire it not just insane it dumb the science is clear we ca expand oil production with new pipelines and keep our planet livable when will that fact get drilled down into everyone heads
mistakes were made but not by me by carol tavris cognitive dissonance and self justification are monumental in preventing people from admitting mistakes of this magnitude same theories apply to climate change and our planet on fire a generation of parents unwilling to admit how badly they screwed their children over
i think one of the best orange cassidy moments was his debate with jericho he had nothing to say except when they asked about climate change on which he had really articulate and detailed thoughts
it has everything to do with global climate change which was actually a problem until global industrialization you probably be hard pressed to find someone who thinks dumping waste into someone else drinking water is just hunky dory well that was news energy environment the company behind the dakota access pipeline is in another or who thinks that the earth turning into an unlivable wasteland fits into their retirement plan you might be opinion donald trump the herald of evangelicals end
elon was among the first to quit that guy gang because he was able to accept that climate change is real
who the fuck are the that do believe in climate change
is that juvenile ad hominem supposed to be mistaken for a rebuttal by whom brain damaged rodents if you ask around perhaps a local middle school may offer remedial logic courses where you may finally learn that dismissing the source is about as pathetic as it gets i you can refute anything there do it since you ca spare us the playground evasions as for your attempt to side track i have no opinion on the matter i accept the scientific facts of gravity the nature of matter anthropogenic climate change etc
yeah in case you had noticed climate change is slowing down and there are plenty of far more efficient and sustainable methods of producing energy which we can use right now making the planet uninhabitable for the sake of profit is more than a little idiotic and imo would qualify as madness
the things we take for granted now were the bars to progress back in the text to speech automated conversations ect they will create a general ai in our lifetime the step from machine learning to self awareness will change the world as we bring forth a new definition of life how that shit will actually play out is anyones guess but childbirth is often fatal for the mother so i am not super optimistic we wo fuck it up between the threat of global climate causing a scarcity that has us wrap this bitch up in a blanket of nuclear winter or some chucklefuck making an ai without the proper protections and protocols i figure much like the chinese curse that we are truly living in interesting times
it true we assholes and shape nature shape being a euphemism for destroy i hope this argument does happen it the anthropocene and we in charge of nature so it up to us to geoengineer our way out of climate change right guys
now the case for swearingen it worth noting that bernie sanders won all counties in west virginia in the presidential primaries and he won the whole state by percentage points it generally assumed that any non incumbent democrat would get mauled in the ruby red state since trump won it by percentage points however who to say that someone who runs on a platform of single payer health care and helping the environment in one of the most polluted states in the nation mind you ca win this is largely because of cross over voting we knew this even sanders camp acknowledged this trump had his primary in the bag and gop voters wanted to run against bernie over hillary furthermore as a ruby red state winning over gop voters is more important than winning the far left the reason trump won so bigly in wv was because he made it clear that he had a plan hillary did could bernie have won the state it very much possible since trump flat out denies climate change lol what plan to make america great again to bring back coal jobs by doing hillary on the other hand had an entire economic revitalization plan targeted for appalachia sending billions of dollars their way and converting their economy to center on modern technology like green energy that was all hillary talked about in that region trump won because west virginia wanted coal jobs back and would only vote for someone who promised those jobs back
if your argument is one of tangibility then i love to see how she made any tangible profit it from what she done so far i wonder if she has a way to donate to her a quick google should tell she won prize money i like to see how she policy energy greta thunberg receives normandys first freedom prize donates it she written a book i wonder if she blogs blog briefing room swedish teen climate activist greta thunberg to donate the money the you exist under capitalism and require money to live haha argument is not one i thought i see someone actually making about climate change activism she started as someone voicing her opinions on climate change and people have taken note of her because of what she represents she is using her social and cultural capital on speaking up to those who have considerably more of that stuff than her yet choose to continue to lie and turn profits from those lies whether or not you think she done something as a person which she has she and her movement have brought increased mainstream public attention to climate change arguments and science it does get much more systemic analysis than writing books on the stuff and giving a speech to eu leaders it unfounded to claim that the action she is literally doing is not activism a dissenting opinion on climate change is likely to be horrible because the largest fight that climate change activists have to fight is the one to prove that it real your reality is all manners of fricked up like please be self aware enough to realize the reasons that people labeled your opinions as dissenting in the first place not everyone who criticizes you and or your beliefs is a pathological ideolog you aware that our world has problems but you blame the entirely wrong group s of people and things for those issues like gay people are fine climate denial is bad two or more sides of an argument are not necessarily in any way deserving of equal treatment respect or mediation
democrats right now see it fault of climate change impeach drumpf
debates is terrible when you consider republicans are hogging air time and they been allowed to talk and decide on what the issues of are immigration planned parenthood syria and nothing about income inequality climate change blm infrastructure education etc the schedule of the debates is horrendous the first one is after voter registration in ny which has millions of independents that could be moved by any dem after the debate but wo be able to vote in primaries the schedule also messed up in that it does maximize the number of viewers reached one is during the xmas holiday season one is sunday night during mlk weekend one is the night of playoffs weeknight viewers far exceed weekend viewers the gop put most of their debates on weeknights the dems put in short the number is questionable the days and times of those is what has many people up in arms only one candidate clearly benefits from less exposure and that the front runner my guess is most people do even know who jim webb is or what he stands for for example more debates and more views is better for any party
was i the only one that rather than get depressed by the spike at the end was instead given a burst of optimism look how much we have achieved in such a tiny amount of time no doubt we will come up with solutions to climate change as well lets just hope that solution is fuck all the poor everyone worth more than a billion jump in a rocket and gun for mars
its over climate change i have the high ground
coyne i suggest is wrong when he writes once you have priced carbon you have given consumers and businesses all of the information they need to reduce their emissions together with the incentive to use it it implies that public transit capacity for example will be increased if carbon is priced it often poor policy to rely on silver bullets most issues do respond best to multi faceted approaches climate change is one of those issues
the biggest problem with nuclear is that it too expensive and takes too long to build the same kwh of electricity can be made more cheaply with wind or solar at this point siting new nuclear is pretty much impossible and new nuclear plants being built are currently way over budget and behind schedule given the pace of climate change we ca wait that long for more new nuclear to be built
because i been alive for almost years and remember all the stupid lies and hoaxes perpetrated by these so called scientists in the it was global cooling global warming cooling warming now climate change i ask you what does it tell you that their own computer models ca simulate historic weather the answer is that the entire thing is a hoax and their goal is to ensure that we end up poor see un agenda and you have your smoking gun edit why is carbon dioxide a bad thing plants use it to make oxygen that we breathe when we have excellent temperatures the world blossoms and life explodes
because the election of the next us president will decide if the whole world is because of climate change and we do cherish the next wave of refugees coming from the middle east either nor do we like putin gaining power each year
people do its just that those results are incremental and our minds are built to recognize that as meaningful it the same reason so many people do recognize climate change as the problem it is
as an actual conservative it a matter of priorities cost benefit analysis i would say that most conservatives along with most reasonable people want to preserve the environment but when it comes to say preventing farmers from accessing irrigation water in order to preserve the habitat of the california tiger salamander it putting the cart before the horse the environment should be preserved because it has value to people when you destroying someone livelihood and violating their property rights it hard to argue that the value of what you preserving outweighs the damage you doing the same thing goes for climate change the most likely estimates from scientists are not doomsday scenarios but peg the cost of climate change at taking us from being something like richer in without climate change to only being richer after the impact of climate change and related deadweight costs that baseline does not justify drastically changing our economy and standard of living for the worst
i was just replying to the post as i thought you were asking in good faith why figuratively the window has shut it because of climate lag it was my post originally that said doing anything to treat climate change would require that the world changes since the changes required are dramatic and would impact the people who basically own the world while the catastrophic consequences are both far off and will mostly affect the poor case study of bangladesh comes to mind i do hold much hope in any genuine effort happening hell our economic model makes it hard to motivate people to even help those who will certainly be displaced so i not holding out hope for us to muster up the herculean effort required to actually change the warming the world is over but the world as we know it is changing and there will be consequences that will negatively affect humans we can no longer avoid that and that the window that was referred to
are u referring to climate change or global conflicts
the organization that came up with this trillion price tag is a republican aligned think tank that hates every kind of regulation all the more galling that a mainly center left sub that purports to care about climate change is trotting it out to shit on gnd without questioning the assumptions that it makes here the actual report by the way if you just take the low carbon electricity grid and net zero emissions transportation system sections which are the parts that we probably do want it trillion and how did they get trillion for hsr we conclude that the rail itself would cost between and trillion this estimate adopts the state of california reported capital cost per mile of system and multiplies it by the bureau of transportation statistics bts reported route miles for modes of the low figure multiplies track mile costs by the difference between air and rail the high figure assumes replacing all air route miles without using existing track yes because it makes total sense to take a cost per mile from the most expensive state in the us and project that onto every single air route currently in operation
i forgot make dubious claims generalizing a giant federation of million people til i learned we do not even have proper healthcare in germany funny i like millions of other americans have proper health care actually great health care we are denying climate change yet the vast majority do not deny it hm put a fanatic christian nutjob in charge of education that the department of education they do micromanage everything btw while also not even filling up our diplomatic staff properly god help us
nonlinear optics i am a pretty bad christian i make it to church maybe once a year and i routinely question the existence of god and and am not very good and holding to the ethical teachings so personally i feel no need to reconcile either i do see stand alone value in the ethical teachings so that aspect appeals and motivates me to be a better human there have been a number of scientists who have pondered these issues at length bacon comes to mind and typically the orderly universe is perceived to be the result of a divine hand my relativity teacher in grad school marveled at the symmetry of the physics of the universe and for him it reaffirmed his faith i know einstein was troubled by quantum mechanics god does not play dice with the universe what i find interesting is how the old greeks firmly believed celestial bodies had to be spheres or move in circular paths as the symmetry of a perfect circle was divine and there was an expectation of the heavens being of perfection early mechanical models of orbital motion did not use elliptical paths but instead followed the more complex circles and epicircles construction of the greeks which worked well enough i think if you believe in an omnipotent being and you realize our brains are finite then you must understand there will be some things our creator does that may be beyond our understanding imagine yourself as a dog trying to puzzle out why people spend so much time staring at a box with moving light pictures this is where we stand if there is indeed an omnipotent creator so i am a pretty bad person to ask about religious faith faith for me comes from repetition of occurrence behavior repeats in reliable patterns that give you faith in the model that explains those patterns religious faith eludes me many times because by training i am so very skeptical as that skepticism hones the quality of my research i have had a few subjective religious experiences that at the time made me firmly convinced of the divine and then as time passed doubt reasserted itself i do not feel really bad about this because if i was designed by a creator to be skeptical then it is my purpose to question and i am as i am intended the left likes to go to big oil skepticism on climate science but i would like to point out that most of the skeptics are not wealthy nor are they funded to refute climate change and frequently put their own careers at risk by tackling the gorilla of climate change what tends to motivate them is the fact that their science has been politicized and the censorship and data fudging and dishonesty of the alarmists do real damage to the integrity of science they do this out of a love for science receive no compensation for doing so and typically are vilified i have seen a few guys in the skeptic community linked to oil but most who i read are not contrast this with those who get funded to study climate change almost all of them get funded by government funding streams i am sure you are familiar with the fact that the greater the severity of the problem the greater the likelihood of funding so there is direct interest in overstating the severity of gradual warming in order to rise above other competing research grants in the funding process
username checks out climate does equal weather you know nasa the organization that put americans on the moon in the here is what they have to say about climate change
actual headline destruction of nature threatens humanity at least as much as climate change warns un
mine runs about half the day in texas i imagine y all can get away with half of that most of the summer and no need for it in april may september october so yeah about a month then if its ran that much it really not that expensive the work to install it has got ta be less than it about for the most economical model as far as i saw which plus installation is at least and it not a year because electricity is paid monthly and people died years ago it not an every year thing that spending a lot of money for something that is uncommonly needed europeans are convinced ac is not an option for them i can see the trouble installing it in year old stone apartment blocks but that just not that many homes overall ac is an option but not a particularly good one it just adds to the problem of climate change at the end of the day also plenty of houses are old here i never lived in a house newer than years old and that was at uni
i will never stop being outraged at this country ridiculous toxic car culture and the car culture politicians it produces we on the precipice in terms of climate change assholes like this ca get a pass
it a bummer to me that you do believe the science behind it i not sure how far removed you are from environmental sciences but i do think there is much debate anymore maybe at one point there was more controversy i a fan of nasa data sets and their resources if you interested the scientific community as a whole is pretty concrete on the matter these days there will always be outliers but the general consensus at least our earth has natural buffering mechansims such as the ocean and plantlife to remove extra from the atmosphere you absolutely right that the earth has natural buffering agents against greenhouse gases but they are limited in their capacity oceans are acidifying slowly but surely over the last several decades dissolved in water makes it acidic this is thought to be what causing the coral bleaching effects in the great barrier reef especially coral as it turns out is super ph sensitive i think what is most disconcerting is that until or years ago the earth has seen levels above in hundreds of thousands of years it over these days and still rising drastically if nothing else we should be paying attention to it and making every damn effort to figure out what that means for us you find that most of the highest production evolutionary eras of humankind have occurred when the climate was hot and people did have to work so hard to make food and keep warm i not sure i understand your point most of mankind history has been slooooww and steady except for the last years or so basically since the last ice age where the planet has held an extraordinarily constant temperature relative to times prior if you trust wiki check this link out basically the last years the temperature has been outstandingly stable arguably one of the biggest reasons we been so successful as a species during this time i think stability has been a bigger factor than warm cold because you do have to adapt as a species constantly on the topic of ice cores i actually had the privilege of working with someone who spent years in the antarctic doing exactly what you stated who randomly switched fields because he wanted to study malaria interesting guy from my conversations with him it sounds like core sample analysis is good clean science and that science tells us a lot lots of chemistry and geology to test exactly what was going on in the world let be real we do have a better way of doing it so i trust the data above anything else i with you that i do think we going to see the earth heat up by degrees or anything like that i do worry that we lose some species though which would be a shame i think one of the biggest things we should worry about is crop sustainability if the bread baskets russia canada plains of us etc of the world heat up or degrees and start getting less rain for example that a tremendous problem acidification of the ocean could also have big effects on global fisheries we might not cook ourselves but we might starve ourselves which i think is a far more likely problem the fact of the matter is we do know exactly what will happen man made or not and i still relatively sure that a substantial portion is man made it a problem and it foolish in my opinion to not try to deal with it i guess one thing i do understand from your viewpoint is the hoax thing what do agencies such as nasa and the department of defense not to mention most of the developed world have to gain by this hoax i mean even the big oil companies are starting to shift the guy trump just appointed as is exxon mobile ceo do like the pick personally but curiously he supports the paris agreements on climate change it worth noting at least i doubt i sway you with anything i said but i do appreciate your response i do agree with your conclusions but i always enjoy discussion and with everyone so caught up in right left i think these discussions are important i try to hunt down that documentary you mentioned never hurts to get more input
no its nonsense there are a whole host of issues that do have an american equivalent for example harper is a strong monarchist yet critical of the purpose of the upper house there is no left right equivalent to that position in the us but on issues that do have an american collorary harper was decidedly conservative he was strongly pro israel he favored austerity and was skeptical of keynesian economics he was not enthusiastic about accepting refugees or the role of the un he has a base of support among evangelical christians and even held a referendum to reconsider the legality of same sex marriage it failed he dropped it as a political because it was bad politics not because he did want to see it repealed and even though canada generally has stong environmental policy harper pulled out of kyoto created bad press for obama while he was still trying to make the decision on keystone xl and was most likely a climate change skeptic obama would not even be close to fitting in with harper conservatives
climate change vs nuclear winter who will win
like let them know to stop doing stuff that is causing climate change they know really the problem is that money is addictive as hell rich shareholders do give a about climate change because they know they die within years before it gets bad are they selfish ask evil as all hell yes will that help probably not just look at trump it not like he actually unaware of the things he did like pulling out of the green new deal people told him in painstaking detail what his actions are doing he did care rich people rarely do
but us media do cover internal policy of european countries so it not surprising i german and not american thanks but the dutch pension reform is peanuts what major european countries would need is whoesale economic reform a beafy climate change program a billion technology fund to catch up to china and the us and a complete reform of the pension system in an age of demographic change none of that is on the menu you take a one party authoritarian state like china who is starting to lead in multiple sectors expands healthcare to hundreds of millions and i give you an interesting number the largest city invests more into ai than germany together we uncompetitve when it comes to governance in comparison we ca even build a modern internet infrastructure
info from an interdepartmental group is not from the epa and does reflect epa policy regulations or rules you straying from the original comment that i would question the motives of positive climate change rules coming out of this administration not being political and money related funny you would disagree and then go on to state other rules were put in place because wait for it politics i agree there are still some good people at the epa i agree some participate to try and reflect climate change i clearly illustrated that this administration has not removed rules based on scientific evidence and given evidence that they have in fact removed tons of regulatory rules for nothing other than political reasons i challenge you again to show any any rule that was repealed due to scientific evidence short of that you going in circles i asked for one example on a rule in the current epa being pulled for scientific reasons and instead of answering you deflect conversation over
yep conservatives do have a problem with science finding that the climate is changing due to human activity we have a problem with doomsday hype science and being told we are stupid retarded red necks for being skeptical of anything basically unless we accept even the most egregious claims as gospel we are shit that is the problem as with everything the left is intolerant not there to help and itself only believes in climate change because it is something they can intellectually lord over other people skeptics so sorry that i am not a true believer and that i question claims as serious as those made by the climate change advocates the fact of the matter is that you have lied in the past in order to push your true agenda so now i am even more skeptical also i recycle have always been environmentally cognizant live in a small apartment and drive a nice but compact car unlike all of the faggot liberals that live in my neighborhood of the highlands denver that drive land rovers audis etc and live in shit quality modern construction condos that now stand where perfectly good year old homes once stood because you have to remain relevant in your late fuck you all
people ca like things because climate change
casual reminder that climate change causes extreme weather spikes in both directions
the cost of living sucks you miles from any change of climate you never get days where you have an excuse to be lazy because of the weather inter island flights are absurdly expensive crowded everywhere the traffic sucks and all the rest people here mention
these protestors could be protesting climate change the missing indigenous women or whatever you notice that they are all protesting something but there is no common enemy the argument is that if they do inconvenient everyone then nobody will pay attention but unfortunately they also do realize that everyone will forget about this shit in a week when it all over so in short the police should do them a favor and arrest them now so they can stop making a fool of themselves
not super familiar with their coverage on the issue but there is substantial finer resolution debate on climate change there is plenty of legitimate disagreement to be had but if one of the sides is saying something like people probably do have a leading major role in the heat gain forcing change or something similar then it probably bullshit the thing is that real information on finer details is poorly understood especially in america
yea you seem to have completely misunderstood what i wrote and instead went of on an old fashioned iraqi diatribe against the other i did even mention gulf countries what did you even read water flows to iraq are down this is going to change most of that is from turkey not iran by the way but it really does matter we are jot getting that water again and have to adapt in iraq produced higher agricultural output than at any time in its history iraqi rivers are brackish already by the time they reach kufa and kut desalination is needed for half of iraqs population at the minimum iraqi irrigation systems within the mesopotamian basin has to be completely changed the desert farming systems we have are fine though iraq needs to utilise its labour local materials and an investment in manufacturing capacity to pivot towards a system of solar power that is enormous plus installed and use that power for everything from desalination to operating irrigation pumps to powering the factories that make membranes solar panels and inverters tp making the pumps and pipes that can be used to forest up the western desert and dramatically improve our climate all of this whilst providing the jobs needed by the millions of young people in the country my original post did mention iran turkey gulf countries the ulooj the zionist conspiracy the british imperialists the godless communists the columnists or even donald duck mate just let go of that nonsensical logic see where that led the delusional saddam and kadhafi
both of you are stupid kids are as dumb as you think they are they deserve the right to vote right to freedom of speech almost all the same rights as adults the climate change protests are kids using their freedom of speech because the future looks bleak for them fact is the boomers fucked over the young people selling out our industry for china for short term gain and it not the chinese we should blame it the boomers the chinese were just taking a good opportunity
it too late to stop climate change
as for the greed bit i was essentially saying i can afford to be completely wrong about climate change we have to weigh our options as best we can it a bit stuffy in here now so i show myself out
personally i love to see more hardwood forests in poorer areas of land that would be amazing tried talking to a couple of neighbours about that before but trees are borderline offensive to some people should we not do that and use our competitive advantage for trade if that works within a framework of reducing our emissions improving biodiversity and we can mitigate the environmental damage and make the business sustainable then sure i personally rather we did but more than anything i like everyone on the same page with regards to climate action we all going to have to change and we all know farmers will be supported in that change more than most which i agree with
lmaooo get your own jokes lol i know it is in your turkish nature to steal others culture and way of being but try at least and make an effort you still do seem to understand climate change is gon na fuck your facist little country and every other country up and the best part is that you can feel anyway you want about it it still gon na happen simple simon ass motherfucker
you going to have a real miserable time when climate change forces mass migration into your cute little bubble lol better get used to it
if only climate change was real and we had some kind of scientific explanation for this
as if it were any worse with the youth than it is with the older generations older generations go on cruises and continue to fuck the environment and climate beyond repair for the younger generations to die by the millions it so much worse and more deadly than what happened here it just more indirect so it is as obviously obscene the lack of empathy is exactly the same though i will not change a single thing in order to avoid killing you fuck you
you fly private i thought you cared about climate change
bad example given there is actual proof of climate change while we have less proof for the existence of jesus than we do for the existence of spider man
the term was intended to replace global warming which as it turns out was entirely accurate since some climates have experienced a downward shift in average temperature if you have a better term i love to hear it for now i try to say man made climate change
this is a big green lie i ca believe people take this seriously the climate change narrative is a false flag to tax us and control us for our own good
preponderance of evidence does not make something a fact if it did we should immediately shut down seti since every bit of scientific evidence we have ever gathered demonstrates that earth is the only place in the universe where life exists ah but we have explored the entire universe yet you argue well to that i retort that we likewise are woefully short of exploring the innumerable factors influencing climate change we did even realize there were thermal vents all over the sea floor until the and did map most of them until the we just now finding out there are vents under the sea ice near the north pole and i sure we discover the same near the south given mt erebus is the world foremost bubbling cauldron of magma according to attenborough in planet earth ii how can we accurately model climate change without monitoring the output of these massive heat generators that surely contribute significantly to oceanic warming do we have sensors on all these vents to measure fluctuations in output is it not at least plausible especially given the spate of massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions of late which surely are mankind fault that tectonic forces might likewise be increasing output from these vents i not here to refute agw surely we contributing since we burn a shitload of things and every city is solar heat sink what i arguing is that until we can account for far more inputs into climate change if not all since that nigh impossible then we should not slam the door shut on debate simply because the vast majority of climate scientists agree on the matter no new einstein has yet emerged to present a mathematical formula provinig agw and until then it remains just a theory consider as well that climate scientists may be chasing the assumption of agw because were they to disprove it they be out of work could that be why they consider their consensus to be equivalent to a fact just as the great scientific minds half a millennium ago all agreed that the world was flat might they have selfish reasons for abandoning the scientific method short of presenting mathematical proof i repeat again that humanity certainly are contributing to climate change since we are arguably significant factors in this system do we know for a fact though that earth has no mechanism for recovering from agw and that we will assuredly render ourselves venutians in short order as climatologists warn how can we be certain of that fate given that we have no prior history of agw to examine in ice cores or soil samples what we do know is that in the past earth was both much warmer and much colder and yet here we are maybe despite the numerous meteor impacts solar events and tectonic upheavals earth has a mechanism to return to equilibrium even if we burn this mother down sure we factors influencing climate change to some extent of that nearly everyone agrees the real question though is whether the harm to our existence is greater if we shut down the machinery that keeps us fed warmed and sheltered or if we might be better off adapting to the changes we do or perhaps do inflict on the climate we build bunkers and seed vaults for fear of nuclear armageddon why not act similarly to prepare for the possibility of oceans rising instead of trying to stop it yes i know half the world lives near sea level and moving them would be a herculean effort but it still something we can definitely achieve whereas many climatologists seem to think we past the point of no return to halt agw that a lot of money and human progress to squander in what might likely be a losing effort
i hate to say it but there were people like that on the left as well refusing the lesser evil option and all that so no vote for hillary they rather million lose healthcare and who knows how many of them die not to mention climate change fucked cause you know they got their principals and shit and a revolution planned too i suppose
facts do matter to these fools heck they all probably think there is no scientific consensus on climate change and it just the ebb and flow of the earth temperature over millions of years
i need to amend this joke to climate change and the religious right a religious man is on top of a roof during a great flood a man comes by in a boat and says get in get in the religous man replies no i have faith in god he will grant me a miracle later the water is up to his waist and another boat comes by and the guy tells him to get in again he responds that he has faith in god and god will give him a miracle with the water at about chest high another boat comes to rescue him but he turns down the offer again cause god will grant him a miracle with the water at chin high a helicopter throws down a ladder and they tell him to get in mumbling with the water in his mouth he again turns down the request for help for the faith of god he arrives at the gates of heaven with broken faith and says to peter i thought god would grand me a miracle and i have been let down st peter chuckles and responds i do know what you complaining about we sent you three boats and a helicopter
every time i come across climate change news i just think what can i do to make this stop or change and everytime the answer is nothing and it so frustrating

no i do climate change wo destroy humanity in any of our lifetimes do listen to that nutjob bernie sanders
nicaragua did sign it because it did do enough trump meanwhile called climate change a chinese hoax to say trump pulled out because it did do enough is disingenuous if he pulled out and tried to shame the world by having the us propose a better plan and going it alone it be one thing but when the guy that wants to bring back coal and thinks climate change is a serious issue and is proposing a better commitment for the us well edit in addition climate change affects us all just because china and india would do enough does mean the us should try is america now holding itself to chinese standards should it be the other way around just because another nation can pollute more we should instead try to keep up on how much we pollute
we have vaccines but they in the incipient stages if the world governments poured an enormous chunk of their resources into industrializing them we might have a chance solar and biofuel incentives are great but everything hangs on whether we can get scrubbers and solar shields working or most crudely using nuclear weapons to knock dust into the air to cool the earth it had ought to be known this last method would work based on the analysis of potential nuclear winters caused by even a small nuclear exchange nuclear war winter global warming environment science climate i may be a layman but the best i can glean from my own readings is that the disease is not incurable rather the question is what are we willing to do to cure it and can we weather the consequences of the cure
climate change is a compounding problem it starts with a steady warming of the climate that severely affects tropical and subtropical regions with worsening drought and heatwaves that steadily wear down the plant life the more plantlife dies the hotter it gets until the majority of the equator is turned barren by degree ground temperatures that make agriculture impossible
in a last ditch effort germany and china are trying to influence the united states not to walk away from the paris climate change accord it signed along with nations in december nearly every country committed to take action to reduce planet warming emissions the us may try to renegotiate the terms of the agreement other countries have to be very clear that they are defending the integrity of the accord and would not accept reduced us commitments weischer we are trying to influence the us through different channels and people at the foreign ministry level to the epa and even the chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly called up president donald trump to remain in this landmark agreement said german environment minister barbara hendricks at the two day petersberg climate dialogue being held in berlin
climate change
i do understand your argument it seems to be climate scientists say we have a short time to stop catastrophic climate change i do believe it therefore we have a long time to stop catastrophic climate change is that right
a person told me their pronouns were they so now i do believe in climate change or the holocaust most trump fans aged in their
i mean climate change is here the arctic polar vortex leaking down onto the us is a symptom of the warming there as it warms the vortex that used to be a circle is now malformed it pulling storms that would hit california farther north and extending polar air down into the south and we ca do anything about this now it the new normal we just have to try to mitigate how worse it gets
you can tax corporations and the scary to and you still would be able get even half of over years you realize that the republican tax bill in opened up a gaping trillion dollar wound over that same span and that we have a lower marginal tax rate than at any other time in history since the fucking gilded age right i suggest that instead of taking money that is yours its the surplus value i create for the wealthy shitheads accruing in their bank accounts while they pay me peanuts so in a roundabout way it is mine its only been reappropriated by some greying year old boomer who thinks that by providing me with subsistence wages they entitled to have the moniker of job creator beyond even that are you saying that the rich should have no obligation to the society which has allowed them to accrue such wealth if that the case it a great argument for the dissolution of the wealthy class wholesale if we somehow encourage people to buy hybrid or fully electric vehicles and the building of more nuclear plants the giant oil corporations would have two choices invest in green tech like some are already or go broke that very cool but how am i going to buy a fucking tesla on a a year budget pre taxes half my fucking paychecks go into rent the other half has to be divvied up between insurance food utilities cell phone bill and at the end of it i am scraping by how exactly am i going to be encouraged to buy an ev hybrid good to hear the oil companies are finally shifting they only denied climate change for years even though their own scientists knew about it in yet they continued to pump tons of carbon into the atmosphere fund climate change denialists and pretend that nothing was happening their willful negligence that is already killing people deserves a trial for the collective harm against the human race they inflicted and yes mainstream and moderate republicans do care much that trump keeps on spending like previous presidents current senators and representatives many of which have been there for decades looks at bernie and they too continue to spend money we do have when it comes to spending on shit the government should be involved in or at least not the extent it is now republicand and democrats share a lot more in common that most people think the right thing would been to cut taxes and cut spending your libertarian dreamday paradise is fucking moronic the un ipcc recommendations state we need an economic mobilization akin to and you did see them slashing taxes for a wartime economy we are dealing with an existential crisis for human survival we have a in chance of the warming over the next years to put us on track for extinction as a species not a civilization but as extant forms of life by the end of the century how are you going to let ones and zeros in a cybernetic database dictate the course of human survival and be fine with that
yo get the fuck out of here with that apathy certainly does solve anything by definition we made amazing strides in clean energy and carbon reclamation tech and while we certainly ca stop all the effects of climate change at this point we can certainly improve things
the meat industry is one of the leading causes of climate change land use and deforestation no it not in climate change it and veggie farms actually contribute more to land use and deforestation they require way more space than animal farms there are bigger issues than meat that we need to sort out to prevent turning this planet into a shithole
try to get governments and people more aware about climate change of which oil companies have known about since the or something
government are being funded by climate change deniers and many sit on boards of oil companies
you seem to be under the impression that putting a young girl up on a pedestal to be attacked by the other side was exactly what the media was going for i not a trump supporter or climate change denier btw so save your time on that response
it been raining here in east europe for almost a week accompanied by really big and random temperature changes which i fear the global climate change might be the cause for
you know what really great for our extinction level event climate change fraud yeah let just fuck ourselves over for money so a few can live lavishly now while the rest of us die of wildfires floods droughts and more lovely
the reason why nothing is changing is because so many americans do believe it if everyone did their part it would help and when every does their part and acknowledges climate change than government will stop pickering and make a change or we can just stop voting in idiots who are ruining this country and earth
the people in power are still climate change deniers even though they are being affected the most due to climate change make sense
in keeping with projection of their own evils being the most consistent theme of the right climate change deniers insist that it climate science researchers who are apparently getting the big bucks to tell lies from someone yet somehow there a distinct dearth of scientists driving new sports cars
we tearing each other apart when we really do need to if we all just got over ourselves and agreed to disagree and chose compassion over hatred we be a more productive generation is this generation the most compassionate generation yet to exist on this earth there has never been as much aid going to third world countries social programs for the disadvantaged have never been stronger the criminal justice system has never been fairer is your argument simply that this is good enough yet or is it that we have made incredible progress even within the last years because the latter is incorrect our recent discovery of man made climate change has just had the unfortunate effect of overshadowing all of our other accomplishments
in your eyes is that behavior that great for a potential president are you proudly supporting her despite these facts if so why are you ignoring something like that if it that or trump it the easiest choice ever again trump is against net neutrality denies climate change is an anti vaxxer has an extremely regressive tax and budget plan that would only benefit the etc thinking in a utilitarian sense if you go on the emails alone it nothing what the worst that could happen from that angle it extremely unlikely she would risk something like that in the white house as president again she more than likely have learned her lesson and there will be far more scrutiny so if it the highly implausible chance that she would accidentally leak white house emails as president vs the horrors inflicted on the populace by a trump presidency again easiest choice ever you would need something much more substantial than the emails or other internal party scandals alone
just because we not doing it does mean we not capable of doing it half the us politicians either refuse to believe climate change or are lying about it does that sound like leadership that is making highly educated decisions based on research there no way our country is living up to its potential so when you say not today i say why in your example the state could pay someone who might have recently lost a job to automation a living wage to be a caretaker that keeps someone from going homeless and it provides to another citizen in need it a net positive for the entire society
if i was an environmental lobbyist working for the american gov or some private company i was at the time portuguese he still believed i was lobbying lmao just because i said that climate change was a real thing
brazil and argentina two of the biggest producers of beef products and animal feed crops in the world argue strongly against evidence in the draft report that reducing meat consumption is necessary to cut greenhouse gas emissions typical from a previous r environment comments the reasons animal agriculture has had to face the massive environmental regulation that it long overdue for are lobbying and the public lack of will to change habits our current consumption of animal products is a major contributor to climate and climate change in turn is a risk to food security and human chapter recognizing this fact the usda dietary guidelines advisory committee dgac decided to consider sustainability in their report to the usda stating that a diet higher in plant based foods such as vegetables fruits whole grains legumes nuts and seeds and lower in calories and animal based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current diet this pattern of eating can be achieved through a variety of dietary patterns including the healthy pattern the healthy mediterranean style pattern and the healthy vegetarian pattern all of these dietary patterns are aligned with lower environmental impacts and provide options that can be adopted by the our work food nutrition previous dietary advisory report in response industry associations lobbied senators to remove sustainability as a consideration from the dietary guidelines for americans dgas in the end the animal agriculture industry was successful in preventing sustainability consideration in the dgas despite public support for its dietary in the eu two industry associations uecbv amp clitravi lobbied in to become leading stakeholders in a public private partnership coordinated by the un food and agriculture organization fao to assess the best way to estimate the environmental performance of eu livestock in the uecbv got onto a project with the eu commission for the development of a harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint of meat what happened with these environmental projects at the end of no scientific output had emerged from any of the previous partnerships beyond press releases and memorandums of positions in short the strategy followed seems to merely replicate a common pattern make great efforts to become a privileged partner in discussions on what has to be changed in order to prevent such change as much as possible by forcing one narrative and the un despite recognizing as early as that the animal agriculture industry was a major source of anthropogenic ghg did explicitly recommend plant based diets as a solution until their srccl chapter summary for even then when given the opportunity to voice the findings of his report the co chair message was weak we do want to tell people what to eat but it would indeed be beneficial for both climate and human health if people in many rich countries consumed less meat and if politics would create appropriate incentives to that it does exactly communicate the magnitude and urgency of the issue even ngos with goals that would clearly benefit from a reduction in our consumption of animal products such as greenpeace sierra club or the world wildlife fund do not explicitly oppose animal agriculture why not in an interview about the launching of his documentary an inconvenient sequel truth to power gore was asked why he did not put more emphasis on eating habits and on the consumption of animal products gore who according to himself has been vegan since provided two reasons for this first personal habits are very difficult to change and second any emphasis on animal products could be seen as an attack on the animal agriculture and food industry that is he recognised that he did not emphasise so as to not bother big business and citizens we can infer from this that green ngos and advocates are strongly reluctant to send messages that may expose the contradictions of society probably out of fear of losing support which could severly damage their finances thus their denial is also essentially economically so there are a few reasons nobody is doing anything about animal agriculture when it comes to climate change politicians are worried their constituents will get pissed off especially if their district is a big producer of animal products and not vote for them people do want to change their habits organizations that should be sounding the alarm are afraid of losing support either financial or otherwise

any article mentioning al gore attracts legions of idiotic right wing climate change deniers ignoring the information provided by the vast majority of the world climate scientists is monumentally stupid right wingers are monumentally stupid they do understand the scientific method or the definition of the word fact the stupidity of right wingers is a threat to us all climate change is the greatest threat to the economy and national security the world has ever faced it time to ignore the stupid right wingers and listen to the majority of scientists
normally i say cooperating with china is bad but the planet does care what country you in if we can work together to fight climate change everyone benefits
well some actual people have suggested depositing sulfate aerosols in the wiki to create global dimming to help mitigate climate change and chemtrails would be one way to do that then again there was pentagon sponsored study about using lasers to control the news dressed lasers weather which is a real thing apparently
biden climate plan has a rating trump thinks climate change is a chinese hoax the choice is clear
this is a pretty conservative area of michigan tim walberg is the representative in my district his public statement is impeachment theater i did not vote for him he does even believe in climate change i definitely going to use resistbot thanks for the assist
by this logic you could replace bernie with any legitimate climate scientist and a healthy chunk of the public bernie is going out there saying wild things designed to inflame his viewers crowd into violent thoughts or acts bernie and those scientists are stating a fact about a legitimate concern to mankind spinning a human rights issue into a roving raping evil immigrant caravan hellbent on destroying america and americans is designed to inflame which easily triggers mentally unstable people into violence trump is culpable because his rhetoric is resulting in acts of violence on other americans bernie is stating that climate change is the enemy trump is saying human beings are the enemy while also promoting violence against those he deems as the enemy that the difference
first i would highly recommend going to a camp of some sort it would extremely helpful for going to your novice year second i would recommend taking a look at the open evidence bin view i t can give you a good idea about what arguments in policy look like seriously the easiest way to learn what some of the things we are talking about is to look at an example edit third post a pdf that explains this better than i have and reminded me that i used that pdf to teach myself when i was a novice for the purposes of this post i going to assume you know the basics like speech times and the resolution if not i would be more than happy to explain i am also assuming you have debated before in a different form of debate this one could definitely be wrong so correct me if necessary here is some of the slang in no particular order both impact generally this is something bad that could happen this ranges from climate change to nuclear war to smaller impacts like poverty terminal why is the the impact bad generally the terminal impact is extinction for smaller impacts the terminal impact evidence will just describe how many people might die suffer from the impact sq or squo short for status quo or the world as it currently is without the plan being considered theory theory arguments are arguments concerning nonexistent rules of debate these are not officcal rules per say but the arguer will try to prove that following this rule would benefit debaters in some way for example a theory argument might say that bringing up new arguments in the is abusive for the affirmative and should not be allowed by the judge affirmative aff shortening of affirmative plan this is the textual sentence describing a theoretical policy that the aff team advocates for shits or stock issues these are the essential parts of the affirmative significance the first of this shits these describe a problem that hopefully the plan will try to solve the next of the shits inherency evidence just says the plan is already happening some wo need to have a specific piece of evidence for it but they will still need to not be already present in the status quo the next of the shits topicality is just a question of whether the plan fits under the resolution most affs wo nt explicitly say they are topical and will usually assume they are most of the time topicality or t arguments will be brought up the negative team this is the last of the solvency evidence states that the affirmative can fix the problems outlined in the s however the shits model is generally considered out of date most affirmatives will have generally a solvency contention and more or more advantages advantage a broad definition of an advantage is a contention outline a specific problem the affirmative solves an advantage contains both solvency just for that specific problem and evidence for the impact of that problem negative has covered most of the neg arguments pretty well so read his post below this one disadvantages are pretty similar to advantages however some would say they are the reverse they are made up links internal links as needed uniqueness and impacts which are all described in on case these are smaller arguments made up of or pieces of evidence that directly apply to the aff case these are usually separated into categories offensive and defensive offensive on case offensive arguments say that the affirmative makes something worse than the status quo these are generally referred to as turns for example if they aff solves climate change then a turn might be that climate change is actually good or that the affirmative makes climate change worse defensive on case arguments case arguments say that the affirmative does not make things better than the sq for example going back to the climate change example a defensive argument might be that there is no impact to climate change and thus solving climate change is pointless and is not beneficial off case arguments these are arguments that are flowed separately these are disadvantages kritik t counterplans and negative theory arguments this post is a work in progress and i will update it as i find time to as of now it is incredibly incomplete
no mention of carbon taxes so i say it is just a begining but international confidence is hard to build specially with the us playing a betrayal card in the prissoner dilemma that is climate change every advance even a mediocre one is welcome
climate change is not going to be good and we need to do what we can to avert it but at the same time everyone from the northern hemisphere had ancestors who had to live through insanely cold shifts in the climate and that was in addition to having no decent medication for anything and horselords or inbred anglo fucks who would sack cities and massacre everyone just because a circassian looked them funny
we still using a lot more than we creating some day norway oil reserves will run out climate change or not
the length and severity of our current drought has been a result of abnormal amounts of atmospheric creating adverse longterm weather conditions like increases in temperatures in other words climate change thanks for sending the infograph link the fact that climate is prone to change is evidenced by fact i do dispute the climate can change and it likely is changing as we speak nb i would probably be a bit more cautious though about speculations regarding the expected future trajectory of global the extent of the role played in this process by humans and what its eventual impact might be given the several several several predictions that have proven woefully inaccurate on this historically anyway back to bushfires even the graph shows that the current average global temperature is about the same as the holocene climate optimum noted throughout bce how can we infer from that that the current bushfires ergo must be unprecedented finally i have no doubt that humanity and its welcome advance on this planet created substantial change for many species and augured an anthropocene era but perhaps the most pernicious impact us humans had on severity of bushfires has been in a much much more direct way arson mischief and per cent of fires are man
sorry i delete it maybe i was thinking of a diferent sub i was thinking because conservatives think liberals are using climate change as a bogeyman but really the picture shows their bogeyman antifa as the real threat
i think that despite what you see on the news in the usa climate change really is debated or doubted in the scientific community there not really an argument about it anymore the reaction is more along the lines of are we still talking about this
nan
i sick of this climate change stuff it a total lie can you explain to me why why would the majority of scientists lie i figure you simply trust trump or something like that but let use some critical thinking so i want to know why you believe the majority of scientists would lie about climate change i like learning so maybe you have a point of view on this
bernie considers global warming the most valuable change to national security he opposed the establishment of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a big effect on the climate bernie bot
i do think we doing science correctly if we start with a conclusion and then guide investigation to reach that conclusion this is what i believe is happening with man made climate change consensus is not scientific original theories have consensus but this does affect the theory in the least same can be said for a theory with or whatever consensus but does stand up to scientific rigor and has no predictive power i do know better than the scientists i agree with them about climate change i know about climate change i know it warmer and i agree to that extent i do know that it human caused and there more evidence to suggest that it not for example do you know about the little ice age it started in the middle ages and ended almost years ago glaciers started receding as temps and levels rose this was decades before the industrial revolution was underway zero powerplants no lightbulbs etc by the time global industrialization really took off in the more than of this glacial melt had happened following the data watching the trend we have a simple natural explanation for climate change that brings us to today climate change is the attempt to create panic in order to advance political causes it uses data models to scare people we seen how when the models do match the observed data they change the models if a model with the does cause enough catastrophe then there a model with that will and even just reviewing the datasets there consensus that there no change a lot has happened since the in terms of industrialization growth and emissions but temps stayed flat or dropped depending on who you ask most people do dig into these things but when you do you start to learn and get skeptical
do you think it a little weird for an eight year old to already have an opinion and protest about something even scientists disagree with i do blame you climate change discussions were everywhere ten years ago tv internet i was like you back then trying to do the right thing save the earth then i realised that protesting is useless that the earth does need saving and future generations will adapt and survive no matter what how many climate change activist stop using their phone their computer stop going to the grocery store use their car and go live in the forest instead not a lot if they were serious about it they would if not they just posing to make themselves look good and feel virtous
i would like for every cell in my body to be replaced with nanomachines and to exist as a nanobot swarm capable of reconfiguring matter in it vicinity for self replication and other manufacturing purposes obviously able to reconfigure and copy itself at will and maintain the neural activity underpinning my conciseness at a distance from my physical i would copy myself repeatedly and start looking into the best ways to address the myriad crises facing humanity climate change and the like while also stowing away on nasa planned moon mission to get myself off world start making spacebound copies to become von neumann probes and to start building a giant death ray on the moon
climate change
if you want to argue against poll results have at it but i do argue against climate change because of what the average person on the street thinks i do suggest that because the average american ca locate tibet on a map that it does matter
that the finest climate change activists comparable to vegans not giving their dogs meat
the eu is working to fight climate change yeah and there were a few dickheads rearranging deckchairs as the titanic sank
whether you want to be or not you actively representing the save the planet group on a public forum at the moment mate attempting to shame someone is only going to work if they actually value your views in the slightest i do mate infact i think you likely to cause more environmental harm than myself through your attitude look at the assumption i m ignorant to the concerns of climate change and pollution just because i do care it a beautiful display of self righteousness given the recent development of prototype sea based capture devices showing significant promise perhaps i do see a need to reduce my personal footprint given the vast investment in this field of technology looking to potentially have fairly significant impacts in the coming few decades
is there any non hopium basis to when climate change stabilizes reefs will return when is climate change projected to stabilize
he also a world class thinker and scientist and understands the scientific method which has led to the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and mostly man made if the only reason this is newsworthy is because he a celebrity then we have the opinions of snooki on the front page of reddit too if she said the same
regardless of whether or not it a good idea to have children it a good idea to contribute less to climate change if you have want to have children
it called man made climate change not global warming
and that cocksucker replaced them all with global warming activists got a link for this nasa research has moved away from manned space exploration and toward earth system monitoring when you know the government stopped manned space exploration and ams assets file says nasa entire earth science budget was requested at while wiki says the requested budget for nasa in its entirety was one fifth of this total would be which means you are claiming that nasa spends twice its entire earth science budget somehow on climate change basically i saying you got all of your info on this from chain emails
my point is that that not the way that dialogue nor free speech nor democracy etc etc works that not even how science works science is not established truth dogma that should remain unquestioned it a method and a open dialogue with different opinions climate change advocates do nt require censorship to delete opposing points of view they can argue their case themselves to put it bluntly regardless of truth or untruth lies propaganda putin bots or whatever it simply the wrong way to go to quote one political theorist christopher lasch what democracy requires is vigorous public debate not information of course it needs information too but the kind of information it needs can be generated only by debate we do not know what we need to know until we ask the right questions and we can identify the right questions only by subjecting our own ideas about the world to the test of public controversy information usually seen as the precondition of debate is better understood as its byproduct when we get into arguments that focus and fully engage our attention we become avid seekers of relevant information otherwise we take in information passively we take it in at all
he good enough we stand at the precipice of complete climate annihilation and a massive global medical crisis that is about to push our already crumbling medical system over the edge good enough is not enough even if biden is somehow able to defeat trump which is unlikely i do think for a second that he capable of taking our country where it needs to go in order to manage such massive complex and systemic problems he will support most of your policies this guy is still going to support most of what you want drastic climate action health care for all education for all taking our country back from the rich and making them pay their fair share legalizing cannabis decreasing the military budget you clearly do know shit about what progressives want biden does support a progressive agenda in any way who the fuck are you to say that biden will support our policies sure i vote for the jackass only because i ca imagine that anything could be worse than what we have now but i deeply resent you trying to minimize the devastation that this loss represents to all the people who have fought for bernie cause and worked to try to see real change in this county you clearly have no idea what you talking about so kindly shut the hell up
especially when those magical things already existed it also baffling that those super highly paid politicians in bruxelles that are supposed to look at the future did try to put into place a roadmap to get away from russian gas after russia attacked in now it impacts every living soul in europe for the worse and for at minimum a year and most likely a few after did think hmmm what if putin goes further nah he only crimea crazy not further but what if he goes further how can he hurt us if we put on sanctions what natural gas firstly imagine if we tried going more independent and perhaps go into more green energy how wasteful of a plan if putin does attack further plus about our climate change we can just declare natural gas to be green problem solved oh and lets build a new pipeline from russia to germany
first rational response in this thread congrats in addition it is currently not possible to model the earth systems the extraterrestrial bodies influence and how they all affect each other to come up with accurate predictions of the future side note ever notice how local weather predictions can not even be accurate even in day intervals or can change drastically it would be like thinking you can model the stock market accurately and predict stock prices also a true model is vastly more complex than the markets the whole climate change issue has been infected by politics and proper scientific analysis has been abandoned it all politics at this point and an attempt at a power grab
summary he was interacting with a vibrant group of young overseas indian scholars students and friends on saturday on last mile energy access in india the e meet was organised by lead india group of princeton university think india purdue develop empower amp synergize india group at university of maryland articulating india energy vision the minister said prime minister modi has envisioned a clear roadmap for india energy future which rests on five key enablers of energy availability and accessibility for all energy affordability to the poorest of the poor efficiency in energy use energy sustainability for combating climate change as a responsible global citizen and energy security for mitigating global uncertainties speaking about pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana minister pradhan said we introduced the pradhan mantri ujjwala scheme in its objective is to provide lpg cooking gas connections free of cost to million poor households i am happy to inform you that we could achieve the target of million customers well ahead of schedule with this lpg connections are now available to of the households in india up from just about in the year he also talked about india energy diplomacy and said india has made its presence felt in the global energy map india under leadership of pm modi is leading the voice of consuming countries demanding for reasonable and affordable price of energy
what is it with solid democratic presidents pulling this smoke and mirrors free trade bullshit at the end of their terms first clinton with nafta and then president obama with tpp first nafta was signed by clinton on december at which point he been in office less than year second it that they listening to the consensus of economic experts you know how we do want politicians inserting folksy wisdom into climate change debate that how free trade works too there is a pro free trade expert consensus that they listening to
the science or at least the basics is not that complex i agree with this the greenhouse effect is easy to understand in principle the complicated part gets when you try to explain the way that warming affects different climates and the complicated changes in weather patterns that emerge as a result the issue is that people who do believe in climate change use ignorance regarding these complicated changes to try to throw the whole thing in question discussing these complicated changes to some degree can help inoculate against misinformation and lies
serious question are conservatives often complaining about pc culture and how people should tell things like they are so let say there a topic where we have convincing scientific evidence that something is happening like climate change and a portion of the country refuses to acknowledge that large body of scientific evidence and instead denies the existence of said climate change under the circumstances denying climate change arguably is very stupid when you consider just how much evidence there is to support it and the fact that the countervailing evidence largely consists of things like it was really cold today in january therefore climate change is real so if someone points out how stupid it is to ignore that evidence that would be telling it like it is right the alternative is to coddle people who deny a large body of scientific evidence based on their gut feeling by telling them that their viewpoint is valid but that would be the height of pc culture gone mad because we would be telling people who are simply flat out wrong based on the scientific evidence that their wrong viewpoint is somehow valid and should be respected just something to think about i not saying a general refusal to consider the viewpoints of others is an admirable quality but i think it fair to say that there are certain issues obviously not all out there where it is possible to have a viewpoint that is actively wrong
evidence if that not enough
climate change is the biggest conspiracy facing humanity and ties directly into war migration and animal abuse i get that trans bathrooms can be used as a distraction but it does matter a lot to some people they got a perfectly valid case the easy friendly and right thing to do is just let them pee in peace
i am late but i would like to join in too the best thing is probably the climate and landscape and the friendly relaxed people the worst thing is that we are not protecting our environment properly and the people have really high rates of child abuse and youth suicide it was a huge waste of time and money and it was undemocratic i voted not to change the flag but i did not vote for the options i would have voted for lazer media photo fire lazar if they had let us many people seem to think it is a very small island only a few kms from australia but really the distances are bigger than some realize i think about how great your social services are including your prison system everyone seems to have enough i think the word for this is lagom good luck with your presentation
hey just a friendly heads up from one of the science mods as many of you have noticed we are removing some things as i noted in there a large number of those are the same person spamming their youtube page on a day old account but we are also removing some other comments basically we leaving anything that is a genuine question and removing things that are poorly disguised and sometimes not even disguised rants the point of this is to ask the amaer questions we are more than happy for you to ask pointed hard questions and we invite it what we ca allow is for it to be a platform for you to rant about your personal opinions on climate change i hope this clears up any confusion
bernie considers climate crisis the most essential change to national security he opposed the establishment of the dakota access pipeline on the grounds that it will have a notable influence on the climate bernie bot
i do understand how people do believe in climate change every year the news is telling us that it the hottest year in history what part do people not get
guns absolutely are the issue for suicide the connection between suicide and gun access is backed by copious amounts of evidence to say otherwise is the same kind of anti scientific thinking that anti vaxxers climate change denialists and flat earthers employ
hey thanks for replying i appreciate you actually putting down where you have problems with the idea of climate change i wish i could have replied sooner but life in any case you mentioned specifically the ipcc report from that a good starting place but i hope we can agree that in the intervening years advances may have been made both in the accuracy of measuring sea level due to technological advances and a better understanding of the oceans themselves having said that let quote the actual report from the executive summary for the ipcc business as usual scenario at year global mean seal level is cm higher than today with a best estimate of cm at the year the rise is cm with a best estimate of cm so that a pretty big range between and cm and that for not for and it was a prediction made more than years ago you acknowledge that sea level rise according to noaa is cm higher than further your link states sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one eighth of an inch per year now i do know if noaa believes that was the rate of rise in but assuming it was about that if you add years x in to the in that noaa has already measured you get in or cm in that seem pretty damn close to the prediction of cm by and we still have more years to go do you disagree with that so given those numbers i not seeing why you have a problem with the accuracy of the prediction on sea level i wo even go into how they underestimated sea level rise in the assessment report the climate change conversation no longer even involves sea levels i not sure why you think this is the case the ipcc fifth assessment report also has a large section on sea level rise as part of working group i chapter and i have not heard anything about omitting the topic in the sixth assessment which wo be finalized until a large part of the climate change conversation was how heat was getting trapped in the earth due to increased levels of there was a consensus that increased levels would lead to less heat being radiated into space however would not the data from the erbe satellite indicate otherwise i not sure why you think a hotter planet would radiate less heat into space think about if you had two cups of coffee one in an insulated thermos the other in a paper cup obviously the one in the thermos radiates less heat than the one in the cup but now let imagine you could add heat to the coffee from inside each container which coffee is going to get hotter the one in the thermos or the one in the paper cup both the thermos and the paper cup are going to radiate more heat than before but the coffee in the thermos is retaining more of the heat in the coffee
she knows she wo bear the burden of human caused climate change as i probably wo too being born into a relatively wealthy country
mhm that s based on projections first of all predicting the economy is a bit like predicting the weather based on sound science understanding and sophisticated statistical modelling by smart people however its not really good more than ten days out in a weather forecast its similar with economics those projections are useless but if they were rock solid then someone would have become the next billionaire by betting on the reliable projections listen my point is two fold no matter which way you slice it per capita total national emissions or ghg emissions per dollar of gdp the is doing much better and is trending down over time you ca have the conversation about reducing emissions without also talking about living standards and economic growth going forward most environmentalists i see talk about this issue completely write that off i assume because they often overlap with the anti consumerist crowds and the anti capitalist crowds you may think that s fine in rich countries like the or in europe where you personally feel people live to well as it is but what about the poor subsitence farmer in africa or latin america or india you going to tell them they ca use cheap fossil fuels to raise the comfort level of them and their families seems awfully paternalistic to suggest such a thing which as it turns news article obama planet will boil over if young africans are allowed cars air conditioning big is something our last president suggested to africans in a visit there i thinks its bogus to hold people in rich countries to some lower standard of living let alone the poorest people in the world what s needed here is an acknowledgment of several things by the environmentalist side markets are a huge part of the efficiency gains it pays to reduce your costs whether that s a household budget or a businesses bottom line profit motive works well here we should hold poor people in developing countries from rising up people are every bit as important as the environment the concerns need to be balanced the real way forward on this issue is technology advancement for example economically competitive fusion would be a massive breakthrough the main byproduct is to light for earths gravity to hold permanently so it floats into space on its own helium gas there is no chance of a meltdown one potential fuel source is ocean water hypothetically enough to power earth at current needs for millions of years instead right now we have environmentalists who allegedly care about science yet support renewable energy sources that contribute to climate change by various other means solar alberto change wind heat and moisture dispersal interrupted in lower atmosphere
we already grow enough food to feed the whole population in us alone we give of the plant crops to farm animals if the world goes vegan of the agriculture land would be saved meat eating is one of the largest factor contributing towards climate change and deforestation livestocks cause more pollution including carbon emissions than the whole transportation system combined globally animal agriculture is the largest man made factor of methane release methane is like times more potent than carbon dioxide if you want to respond to this you can message me in dms for a fruitful conversation it making me wait for minutes to reply
climate change
i was told to just vote for whoever has d next to their name and then climate change will be over i think the dnc is useless and they do deserve anyone vote at this point they control both houses and the presidency but ca even protect women basic bodily autonomy or raise the minimum wage to a miserable how could they possibly deal with climate change it requires real commitment and standing up to corporate hegemony the democratic party is committed only to the continued dominance of capital over human life the usa does have any serious party that represents the working class and until it does it will continue sliding toward barbarism
due to climate change horrifying animal human hybrids become common weebs when they realize all they need to get catgirls is global
yeah the us is one of the last western countries to finally do something about climate change and they act like now they the leaders in climate change for some reason
i do think this is limited to any geography because the economic impact of the next twenty years will hit everywhere regardless if we talking about asia or europe or africa or america even traditionally first world issues like over aging or obesity are hitting countries like china now climate change is global anyway as is migration the right falling back to nationalism and the left falling back to socialism is really silly
this is reddit why would he give a shit about spelling or the information being statistically relevant to questions unrelated to his own it you that is off base here he not trying to publish in s journal he posting on reddit posting a graph to analyze whether the weather has changed over the last years and finding it has had significant change is remotely related to climate change research or any scientific study for that matter does mean he is wrong
they think that the most important thing they can do is to not offend some foil hat wankers they only recently decided that when discussing climate change that they did have to have some bought and paid for climate change denier on to balance things out let see the reaction when they have to get an atheist on to songs of praise every week just to give a balanced view fuck them they are the worst spineless and craven
it our business what the most powerful man in the world does but i agree that the protests should have a specific goal rather than just being anti trump climate change seems like the most important issue
dealing with climate change
climate change deniers this phrase is indicative of a political view point not a scientific one be careful when you use it that being said what the problem with opposing views in science especially in light of incomplete information
one of the few things i like about my current government is their handling of the climate change file we seen very very noticible differences where i live in the case of extreme weather it really concerns me
climate change for sure

its criminal that this governnment would close down the future funding of the very underpinnings of a modern society leaving australia both further exposed to reliance on fossil fuels when the inevitable rush for the fossil fuel exit door comes from our trading partners and thus exposed to climate change if people can sue tobacco companies for hiding and ignoring evidence of future damage to health from smoking maybe its time a class action was constructed to sue this government and their climate denying billionaire supporters for taking action in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that exposes this society to greater risk of economic and ecological dislocation and damage phony tony and his jokey mate are sending us up shit creek and are burning the paddle
i am not sure that my solution would be acceptable to either establishment moderate centrists or to bannon alt right unfortunately let pretend i made dictator of the united states with free reign to do whatever i like i know it a bit fantastical so i hope you indulge me here are the choices i make in order immediate universal healthcare likely through a public option massive upgrades and investment in medical supplies and personnel lots of construction of new hospitals and clinics particularly i like to send medical vans door to door in rural areas for health and wellness checks mandatory for children optional for adults and dramatically increase access to clinics in cities all doctor prescribed medicine is free through the public option and pharma prices are negotiated or let be real if i were dictator set by the government this greatly increases demand for doctors nurses other healthcare professionals as well as construction medical research and technology etc indefinite free tuition for public universities you can attend for free as long as you like understaffed and essential professions like medicine and education would pay people to attend although rigor would increase as often as possible pork administrative fees and wasteful show off facilities are heavily restricted additionally massive investment in head start programs and education essentially i like to move as many people as possible out of the workforce and this incentivizes them to stay in school also increases demand for teachers professors etc massive investment into infrastructure new roads bridges public transportation water and sanitation public parks green homes and offices green energy production national parks fast and reliable fiber internet public wi fi and charging facilities disaster prevention and so on lots of new construction and logistics jobs the following changes to taxes and income zero corporate income tax abolish minimum wage close all tax loopholes for the wealthy very high tax rate on the wealthy equivalent to historical highs in terms of real tax tax capital gains equivalent to other forms of income government subsidy for automating facilities study and implement cuts to all waste in the defense department end subsidies to oil companies and other industries antithetical to the long term prosperity of the american people tax on capital equipment facilities etc increase property taxes particularly for corporate use tax public goods facilities if industry is using them air water etc tax on pollution carbon taxes etc and other undesirable effects of industry implement universal basic income investment in research about combatting the effects of climate change space exploration medical advances advances particularly ethics and philosophical concerns human psychology and mental health basically just lots of science research complete overhaul of criminal justice system all drugs are legalized investment in healthcare includes public outreach and treatment for addicts mandatory body cams corruption rooted out and eliminated strong emphasis on community policing and restoring relations and understanding between the police and the communities they serve psychological evaluation and assistance for police officers sociopaths would be fired or moved to non dangerous positions those with strong negative biases or other treatable psychological conditions would enter treatment ban private prisons much greater focus on rehabilitation in prison more research into the causes of crime and preventative measures if i were not actually a dictator i would also want amendments passed to get money out of politics implement a fair vote system ranked choice voting for instance abolish the electoral college pass reforms on political parties they would no longer be considered private organizations and would have to legally abide by election rules and so on as i a dictator in this scenario however i suppose the point is moot apologies if this list seems unrealistic etc there a lot more i could do but i do want to go on forever i see pretty much anything moving toward these goals as a positive
the reason why i know the earth is flat is because people that actually know the shape of the earth do care what other people think nor do they have to compunction to ridicule those that think differently to feel good about themselves i sure there plenty of metal heads in the scientific community but they are a very small minority most of them are atheists with emotional attachments to untestable theories like evolution black holes and climate change any theory that ca actually be demonstrated is real science and the globe is a theory that has been disproven over and over again it the atheist religious zealots that are aware that they socially engineered religious zealots if you really knew you would care what i have to say you are demonstrating your lack of confidence by investing this much time being so serious about something you so certain of in a sub about humor i appreciate the extra laugh
well i did ask to be born if that what you are talking about also just because there was a pandemic from to does mean that there had to be another one we are supposed to be going forward not backwards there is also climate change famine and overpopulation the resources are becoming more scarce and so on but yeah the pandemic is the problem
ben shapiro owns sjw over climate change etc and so forth
in the future where flying cars interplanetary colonies and deep space travel are the did people expect there not to be standardized industry and everything public research and charity work serious question people act like this is a death knell for nasa and publicly funded exploration research and development it is not frankly hitting musk on being an entrepreneur in space is only working to hamper the goal of having a normal economy outside of this blue dot of ours nasa will always be a regulating body nasa will always be developing on the edge of science and exploration they will always be there to lead musk and spacex are simply following where nasa has already gone if anything all those who dreamed of the future should be happy because this is progress it gives nasa a goal beyond low earth orbit spacex is also not hampered by corrupt politicians paid off by the oil and mineral industry spacex ca have their budget yanked by corrupt congress critters whose donors bottom line depend on not seeing the effects of climate change and being dependent upon fossil fuels the future is electromagnetic we are still limited by giant rockets on volume and weight heavy fuels if anything musk has set up a venture and collection of companies that will propel the species beyond this solar panels industrial scallable battery technology and space logistics that is what spacex really is a logistics platform the trucking industry of space who wants to see electric rockets powered by modular solar batteries that can be hot swapped on demand and charged in low earth orbit that is what spacex aims for thus the electric car in space we should be happy for that this frees up nasa to go bolder and lead the way even further nasa sls and orion program are coming up that is a real mars and moon colonization vehicle nasa is dying it is evolving now who wants to see mining space rocks for minerals we got private industry developing that one of the main factors we fund the crap out of the military and not nasa is because bribery and corruption are legal in this country those who are the power brokers and decision makers are heavily influenced by keeping us on the path of oil and scarce minerals this is also a component of why crypto coins are taking off and becoming more mainstream scarcity of something needs to replace gold before we collapse the gold market and send the world economy to hell digital gold space bucks for centuries wars have been fought over billionaires pissing match for control of resources what is going to happen to the minerals market once the golden nugget is found in space what happens when we find a space rock that contains half the world gold what happens when we start mining the moon and titanium becomes as plentiful as moon map lunar that is the serious reason why there have been moon bases yet this is the motive why we fund wars and not space exploration this is why private industry has to lead the way right now because our political forces are corrupted to absolute hell by greedy bastards whose worth depends on the status quo and refuse to evolve when they very much have the ability to do so they just do want to sink money in doing so because even if they do and they still will be rich they are psychopathic greedy bastards that faint and have epic childish tantrums if a single penny does turn a profit now if you want to discuss musk labor practices that is another thing all together we can urge elon to unionize and treat his workers better and fairer most of them know what they are signing up for however the labor area is a larger conversation within the country and not specific or exclusive to spacex
all of the renewable power generated by installations built since could have been produced by nuclear power plants you keep waiting for renewables to save the day meanwhile it clear what our past decision to forego nuclear has done for climate change and it should be clear what continuing to forego it will mean all that wind and solar is displacing any coal power only gas is displacing coal why because renewables are too intermittent to warrant dismantling any coal plants because you still need them does matter how many solar plants or wind turbines you make without grid level battery energy storage good luck you will always need the dependable power plant to provide your energy coal gas nuclear oil i suppose choose
a bit different no screenshots required
rainfall will be more severe when it comes heat waves will also become much more deadly when they come and droughts when they come will be much longer three defining aspects of climate change are stronger storms rising seas and erratic weather patterns there is nothing reassuring about extreme weather events they cut both ways
let note how we are now in and the minimum wage promised in this tweet is still not there the current federal min wage is still the same pathetic hour it was back then also was the supposed biden plan for climate change supposed to be based on green parts of his infrastructure bill that never passed
provided we survive the effects of climate change that is
climate change rabble rabble something unscientific rabble rabble
and yet our hands voted in trump and the gop who deny that climate change even exists we could fix this but we probably wo that is the reality that you will read on r collapse
the greatest threat to climate change is our population and the population growth since when do we as a species need preservation efforts
based on my research the best defense against climate change is altering local micro climates permaculture food foresting rainwater collection a mind for use of local resources with an eye to renewability and sustainability are going to be the keys the planet is being over taxed because of the strain of holding up global economies and infrastructure if we start small and keep it small each region of the world will be able to buffer itself against climate change and eventually hopefully reverse the effects of it
yta what does shopping online and getting stuff delivered have to do with climate change also mind your own business
literally burning the money would do more good for climate change than giving it to republicans

if i could vote for two it would be social media and climate change bc they affect our society in different ways social media has ironically made people less social in person and is linked to increases in depression the threats from climate change are bit more obvious
it a bad source because there is only a small survey a statistic listed with no source and like sentences in total one of which is kellyanne conway talking about fucking your source is also from fucking aug that was more than years ago so many things could have changed since then my source did say anything about reproducing but you clearly missed the logical link the children surveyed in my link are the children being referenced in your article children teens and young adults skew heavily toward democrats so at least one of the assertions that there would be more republicans that of people vote like their folks and that democrats are having less kids are false my source also had a sample size times the size of your source and it was from year ago and much more relevant to my comment i get that logic is your strong suit as you seem to be a climate change denier but you at least have to see that a word post that talks about republicans fucking is asinine
i wonder how this would change the north american climate
first i agree with you about the left frequently being condescending i fairly liberal but i have more family members that are republican than democrat and virtually everyone i work with is an enthusiastic republican i frequently find myself disputing comments that say stuff like all republicans are racists it a caricature i do have to say i see this a lot with people that associate only with like minded people some of my republican friends seriously believe that elite democrats hate america and have an agenda to lower its standing in the world and make it a socialist hellhole they understand the average democrat might be a nice guy but they seriously convinced those people are just being duped by the evil george soros of the world my liberal bubble family members tend to believe that all republicans are either ignorant knuckle draggers or moneyed elites out to screw the common man it easy to believe the worst of the other side when you isolate yourself from them whether you democrat or republican however so is the left wing media which is basically every station but fox i consume a pretty wide variety of news media stuff like and are obviously biased even when they report something accurately they often interject little attacks just to emphasize their contempt slate and the new yorker have some good stuff but it fair to label them liberal msnbc liberal although its parent company nbc news really is but i have to say that the bbc and npr are mostly unbiased the new york times and washington post both have excellent journalistic standards it would surprise me if they have a disproportionately democrat leaning set of reporters but it usually does come through in their reporting because a they source carefully and b have editorial standards regarding tone i also add that with any news service you have to be careful whether you reading something that comes out of the news department which has one set of standards versus an editorial or opinion piece which have much lower standards in terms of fact checking and they allowed to express strong personal opinions like paul krugman in the ny times is a nobel winning economist so he as high an authority as it gets when writing on economics but he also a liberal and he unabashedly advocates various liberal policies and his column is very intentionally in the opinion section it easy to see a column like his and figure the entire paper is in the bag for the democrats but it really not true their news department strives to not take sides check out this us politics clinton dnc russia reporting the then breaking news that the democrats paid for the steele dossier to me that looks like solid reporting even though it making the democrats look bad anyway back to your point i agree with much of it like the left on student campuses are getting ridiculous they believe in free speech as long as they agree with you but they prevent you from speaking if they disagree wtf and the ideas of trigger speech microaggressions cultural appropriation and safe spaces are all toxic there a lot wrong with the left but overall based on just policies i find myself unable to side with republicans on key issues that are very important to me like i am pro life cutting taxes on the rich does not fuel the job creators i strongly believe in the global scientific consensus on climate change and i deeply concerned about the size of the deficit something that republicans are worried about when there is a democrat in the white house then happily blow up when they control things the bush tax cuts blew up the deficit the entire iraq war was funded via emergency funding so they did have to raise taxes to pay for it and now they working on another deficit busting tax cut bill it disgustingly irresponsible
you are the child you can not see that you are shooting your argument about climate change before it can even be made
just greta fanboys needing attention they do want you using a snow storm to discount global climate change warming however they ironically reserve the right to use a forest fire a flood and a bunch of healthy children mysteriously getting myocarditis as evidence of catastrophic climate change
not saying they climate change believers are wrong but for the sake of argument if they are wrong the worst that happens if we create a cleaner world is that we tank the global economy due to substantial increases in the cost of energy leading to large scale increases to poverty hunger and disease and a massive decline in the rate of development in the developing world which is highly reliant on cheap energy like i said i not saying climate change is real i saying that it a fallacy to say it going to be easy or that the worst that happens is we create a cleaner world
so mr buttplug you do want to use fossil fuels no digging no drilling no mining and no fracking rather you are encouraging evs so mr buttmunch how would the us get the resources to make all those ev batteries here in the us if we import those resources or batteries where did the country we purchase from get those resources to sell or make the batteries the us would need to purchase for all those evs and how are you proposing to build the infrastructure to support charging all those evs across the us roadways what will you need to build a charging station in the middle of nowhere on say or or are people going to be limited on routes designated by this charging port infrastructure you are proposing which makes it easier for you to monitor and track by the way so mr butthurt are you saying that you support mining drilling and fracking as long as its not done in the us because of climate change and the us has to do our part does it help the climate and the environment if other countries continue to drill mine frack and process all the resources to sell trade to the us
climate change does not exist by this i simply mean the climate changing is not as bad as the liberals say it is yes the climate is changing it is natural and not caused by humans
it less misleading than attributing climate change to individual action we not going to reduce reuse and recycle our way out of this the snopes article itself mentions that fossil fuels are the largest source my cutting back on single use plastics is going to stop the carbon emissions from setting concrete for power generation for crypto miners for ghgs emitted by international shipping if the lockdowns in showed us anything it that even under ideal conditions where everyone drove less and consumed less ghgs still went up just less quickly that article is just nitpicking and ultimately serves to further the narrative that we as individuals can make a significant impact not industries and governments
thank you for this thoughtful write up blaming everything on population growth is another way of distracting us from actionable items on the climate agenda or you want to fight climate change just do procreate just focus on that while we maximise our profits by shifting production to places with few to none environmental regulations please make sure to remain childless while we try to placate the oil lobby buy removing subsidies for renewables and allowing development of new oilfields how about policies to curb food waste and taxing non biodegradable packaging instead of saying you being born is our main problem
in four regression analyses distrust of public service media swedish television svt socioeconomic right wing attitudes and negative attitudes toward feminism and women were the strongest predictors of climate change denial these variables outperformed conservative ideologies right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation anti immigration attitudes distrust of the parliament and courts and belief in conspiracies in predicting denial party preferences explained only a small or zero part of variance in denial over and above these variables it notable that climate change denial correlates with some of those things but not others
the point about arsonists and negligence is well taken and i do know how many that accounts for of the fires on this map all three of teh ones that are fully contained as of this post the holy fire was actually started by a resident in the area every house in that canyon all year old historical sites burned down except one the house that the arsonist resided in the other fires i believe started from natural causes but aronsist set new ones downstream that eventually merged to join them i think it mostly down to a combination fire overmanagement as mentioned years of stamping out every fire as quickly as possible rather than letting it run its course and reduced or changed rainfall patterns a big storm that drops of rain in hours vs smaller storms that drop that over the course of a week whether the latter is a result of california entering another super dry period as has been seen in the geological record or a result of anthropogenic climate change is matter of valid debate but anthropogenic climate change should be dismissed out of hand forests are being overmanaged anymore parks services and others are doing things like authorizing thinning out highly at risk forests allowing dead or about to die trees to be cut and sold as cheap lumber etc and at least on federally controlled lands like the marine bases techniques like backburning intentionally doing controlled burn to kill off things like weeds without killing all the trees are used successfully i not dismissing acg out of hand nor do am i opposed to spending significant political capital to address acg i just think that higher frequency and intensity of property destroying fires in this case has more to do with different aggravating causes i actually thing we should start to phase out income taxes and phase in carbon taxes in a way that keeps government revenue neutral let people keep more of their money then use that money to vote for technologies that are more environmentally friendly with their wallets and imo i like to see large scale projets similar to manhattan project apollo the interstate highway system to actively reverse a lot of the harm cased by acg for example doing things like reforestation sinking by growing algae to be buried using pumped water artificial snowmakers to increase ice reserves near the poles and on mountaintops etc though for that to work we read humanity will have to re empbrace nuclear power which i do see happening outside of china
fun fact due to climate change it is now too warm in some areas for bears to hibernate
or you can see the arctic sea ice is hitting record lows as we speak and we will be dead from climate change related collapse anyway
what does an anti climate change motif even look like
or even home grown vegetables and fruits they taste a lot better and different than those sold in stores i think people who think there are absolutely no benefits to eating organic sound almost like climate change deniers
i sure poor people from developed countries will suffer a lot and only get poorer as the effects of climate change kick in
all of these are valid approaches the only change i would make is on the first and second ones if you are talking an diameter branch and you are bucking it in to rounds by rounds here i assuming that you are referring to lengths of the whole log and not fully prepared round blanks i leave them more like at least long to allow you to later trim off any end checking and cracking that occurs sometimes there no stopping fruitwood even with the end sealer the third approach is the most fun since you get to turn the wood when it is very wet and the roughing out process goes very quickly check my post i just posted a long album on doing just that for this approach a good rule of thumb is that you want to leave the thickness of the rough turned bowl at about of its diameter so for a salad bowl you shoot for a wall thickness of about then there will be enough left after it dries and ovalizes to still get a circle out of it when you are done roughing it coat completely in green wood end sealer and set aside to dry anywhere from months to a year depending on your climate and the size of the bowl if you want to get precise you can weigh it every day or week on a food scale and it will get lighter and lighter then when it stops changing weight it ready to go a fourth approach and to me this is even more fun is to work green to final thickness in one go if you can get it down to anywhere in the neighborhood of inch thick quick enough it generally wo crack and especially in a natural edge bowl or a calabash shape the warping that occurs can really compliment the form but i do recommend fruitwood for your first it really is a race between you and the checking maple and ash are a lot more forgiving
degrees that ai people where i from drink iced coffee when it degrees or less i had to give up coffee because it made me too jittery i love tea but i wo start with the iced tea until about degrees which sometimes happens in february now what with climate change
why is this getting posted weeks later clearly an attempt to get people arguing about climate change
damn she was hopped up on adderall or something but at the start of her ramble she does say climate change is always changing she was able to refute any points well which is weird for someone who is in the public eye joe main point is that scientists said humans contribute to climate change my point would be so do most animals and what are we expected to do go back to the stone age climate change is being forced down our throats with no real solution

the un designated leo a a messenger of peace with a focus on climate change he given a bunch of talks at the un regarding climate change his meeting with her would seem to be less about his acting career and more about his role with the un personally i would categorize it is people magazine bs
just youtube bronze age collapse and that give you a rough crash course edit to be very brief the bronze age societies empires of the near east ancient egypt hittites babylon minoans mycenaean greece troy collapsed in dramatic fashion during the period there still is complete consensus why it exactly happened with many theories ranging from climate change disease and as alluded to here the sea peoples ancient egypt was the only one to survive and i ca stress enough how they nearly did and what records we can find point to named iirc peoples raiding coastal settlements in a way that would make the vikings blush the whole collapse is massive wide ranging and highly controversial as to its cause however it mightily fascinating
i pretty ruthless indifferent towards the lives of people that i see as being detrimental or dangerous to society as a whole it is not an exaggeration to say that i would piss on a poacher anti vaxxer climate change denier religious extremist trump voter if they were on fire i do broadcast these views but neither do i hide them ironically my friends and acquaintances think i joking when i say something like this because i known as considerate and generally very helpful i just far more pragmatic than i am compassionate and although ethically i ca push them off the cliff i have zero issues with watching them jump off it

something about the university of life and hoping you die of climate change
the deep rejection is that redditors have completely convinced themselves that any self sacrificing solutions to climate change are morally correct and that anything else is selfish and evil on this site i very often see the adage that it harder to unteach something than it is to teach something the response to advancing leaps and bounds in carbon capture is proving that do you get the idea that a lot of people in this thread would be pissed off if climate change were solved but we all were able to continue living our lives as normal at what point does this stop being about the material problems of climate change and start being about what a weird group of people on reddit want the world to be
humans will either go extinct through nuclear war or climate change before creating a machine civilization or it will create a machine civilization and then live a comparatively small and simple history in that civilization shadow or be destroyed by that civilization if that machine civilization is made and it favors growth it could gobble up the local group and turn them into dyson swarms as you said per unit energy and unit mass maximum lives can be lived thoughts experiences experienced by running the mind directly to put a mind in a vessel and that vessel in an environment and have the mind experiences take place in that environment is extremely wasteful by comparison basically either consciousness dies by climate change or nuclear war or it probably turns the local group into computers to run countless instances of consciousness it could do this for trillions of years using black holes as energy sources
climate change
i confused if scott does care about addressing climate change then should he be praising it for being ineffective or for not impacting farmers or whoever like they say they care about what is with the right being climate deniers but at the same time wanting you to think only they care about the environment either it a problem or it is
sure eaarth by bill mckibben is a great book on climate change for a more fun book try the age of misinformation stiff or bonk by mary roach are both really fun reads too one on the use of human cadavers and the second about sex research she a science writer
i do not understand refusing to vote for biden if you live in a state that biden is a guaranteed win in like in california i voting for bernie because biden will win the state and all electoral points this is the case in many places though in my opinion biden is better than trump even if he is a moderate in comparison to bernie trump is quite literally campaigning to be an authoritarian ruler biden definitely is and that one reason why i would vote biden if i had to another huge factor is that biden acknowledge that climate change is real trump does not this decade may be a make it or break it situation for combatting climate change and we need someone who at the very least is in denial about it
i do see outcry for censorship in america mainstream media when the last time you heard any in depth reporting on climate change if censorship is government driven or profit driven it still censorship
again you missing the entire point of the comment i not against evs i saying that pretending we can just ask billion people to just buy less is a ridiculous way to solve the problem of climate change secondly your numbers are based on ideal situations life is not ideal for example in germany evs actually do not help reduce your carbon footprint articles germanys dirty green i all for investing in new technologies including more eco friendly ev manufacturing to combat climate change but the belief we can just ask people to change their ways is ludicrous
shell have been planning for climate change since the or admittedly that included the conclusion that the public would be prepared to make the sacrifices required to stop it
i really envious tbh we have plenty issues of our own i usually say we are safe our judicial system mostly works and we have snow instead of lagoons but other than that we are basically you our new chancellor was sworn in today he is known for being in bed with deutsche bank and other big financiers then again merkel was just as corrupt she was just very careful about what she said so foreign people loved her but we voted a lot of greens into the parliament who want to combat climate change and many yellows who want to invest unlike merkels blacks who only maintained the status quo for years and let the country rot so we will see what happens
you got a source on the ft of water for the entire eastern seboard within a generation or hyperbole much i think he talking more about the fall of democracy which i agree the younger generations seem to be the best hope of preventing i not belittling climate change but i never heard any prediction even a that bad for the next years
climate change is far too complex to predict anyone who says carbon emissions are warming the planet is an ignorant asshole with an opinion
climate change promoters are a death cult
a this is literally in reference to the state of florida gop rejecting math text books for teaching crt b republicans have consistently rejected things such as vaccine science climate change evolution the big bang etc qed republicans are rejecting math and science
while this is going on meanwhile in australia facebook wo do anything to stop climate deniers capitalising on australia bushfire hannahryan facebook australia bushfires climate change deniers facebook
it needs to happen in ways that incorporate a just transition i agree replacing junkers old boilers and shit windows are prime examples where ham fisted policy will hurt the poorest it definitely not for zero tangible gain though air pollution contributes to the early deaths of people every year in this country two thirds of covid death toll replacing junkers old boilers and shit windows will tangibly improve the lives of everyone the poorest the most as they are most likely to suffer with these things first hand damp houses respiratory problems higher energy bills fuel poverty better cycling infrastructure will improve national health wind power should have brought along a booming industry in this country instead it was mismanaged and it largely in denmark but it shows the opportunity was there changing the way we travel will benefit local economies that all economic and health related let alone the more direct impacts on nature and climate i think people would be more amenable to those taxes with that framing what if we thought of cars as the new second hand smoke and lifted nhs demand instead of something that will stop floods in bangladesh as someone who works on climate change i think there a perception that climate change is some spurious thing that only happens in the amazon and the maldives but we have to change in the uk because of it a fair and just transition should also bring benefits locally too this is to say a transition will be without hardship though it not all pie in the sky i personally take the view that these measures are a new tax but a cost that has been there the whole time we just failed to factor it in we not creating something new we actually reverting to the status quo
luxury i have to get up minutes before i went to bed the night before so that i can sit in traffic for hours longer than i get to ski all so that i can sell one kidney for tendies and fries for lunch at because there are any other time slots for eating indoors after freezing my ass off in riding over hard pack thanks to climate change
stuff like this is why i always played the eco faction in alpha centauri some climate change deniers just need a load of mind worms chucked at them until they less stupid i swear bad shit is happening in front of our faces and those idiots will just be like oh well it always like this right not a big deal ugh after climate change deniers there going to be a surge in we burned the climate on mars so bad we had to move to earth people again like after anything to avoid discussing what we doing to our own planet we need the next save the whales trek iv spock wears a bathrobe combination if we going to save the planet from ourselves soon before we have to teach people exactly what terraforming is
its propaganda yes climate change is a massive problem but that is only the top level message the underlying message is one of cooperation and hope probably setting the general public up for a larger propaganda drive telling us everything is fine as long as we the human race do something about a couple of these minor issues telling the masses that everything is fine is an attempt at calming everything down
the fires will be back we done nothing to mitigate climate change to be expected with a denier in charge and murdoch to silence any scrutiny
i am not a climate change denier i believe the globe is warming i just do think we need to take drastic measures to combat another doomsday prediction hurricanes strength goes up and down on average hurricanes where weaker from then they where from three decades ago so no they are not constantly getting stronger or increasing in intensity is the proof your own attached graph says in years ago the sea water level was approximately inches higher than it was in so i do know about your claim that the of level rise inches you talk about happened in the last years is mathematically accurate like many of your fellow climate change is the end of the world believers i have no doubt you will ignore actual unbiased facts and gravitate to the misleading and inaccurate statements that sustain your beliefs i hope this explains for everyone else why climate change is happening but it is not the end of the world and should not be a main priority of the world because it will not quickly and majorly effect the world i hope everyone knows that the sea level will continue to gradually increase over tens of thousands of years just like it has for the previous tens of thousands of years and the world will keep on spinning
after years of republicans disrespecting obama and years of smearing hillary clinton and republicans trying the same damn thing with alexandria ocasio cortez and joe biden etc etc crazy republicans want liberals to respect their corporate stooge racist human caused climate change denier criminal with mob and russian ties sexual predator reality tv president v o t e the democrat candidate
someone recently informed me that all wildfires were not due to climate change and were intentionally started by eco terrorists closed my eyes shook my head and walked away but i would be surprised to see that become a main stream far right narrative in the future
since everyone else is talking about the ads which were too much i wanna talk about the actual content i glad that they paid such a big portion of the episode to climate change and that joe knows his shit about it i think it was a genius move by him and his campaign to tie their environmental plan to a jobs plan as well as an infrastructure plan as it makes it much easier to get it passed through congress if dems get the senate that genius was clearly on display here when joe was talking about how much change his plan can bring not only to the climate but to the entire economy i really hope that once he gets into office it is one of the first things he focuses on and he really seemed to understand the situation that we are in
to make the big changes they ca cut off there nose to spider face i a biden supporter who works if you go straight to a frack ban you can say goodbye to the inroads in the rust belt he made this last election cycle the next administration in four years will just reverse it anyways with thin margins in the house and senate there no way a federal law will be passed to ban fracking he stuck to exactly what he said he would do no more new leases on federal land and no frack ban the biggest change he can make in the fight against climate change is more investment in renewables and making evs viable in the state with an infrastructure plan that includes interstate charging stations
this was a discussion a brainstorming session with a compelling argument about why drastic measures are needed to avert or slow down the impending climate catastrophe is getting any lower and industrial civilization is plowing through the planet like a freighttrain with no brakes i for one liked the discussion because not enough people will take a leap to even talk about what is uncomfortable and could will drastically change the course that civilization is on cheers and i hope it leads to many more discussions and eventually some action by those able to initiate and follow through
actually there is one recent migration event that can find its origins in climate disruption syria had a devastating drought in the this led to the displacement of million farmers to damascus social tensions grew and the syrian arab spring started in this led to the rise of isis and the creation of their caliphate the actions of the jihadis provoked a mass migration to turkey which overflowed with syrians millions decided to march into europe in the summer of agreed syria could have mitigated the drought by controling its demography quintupled in years which forces assad to be ruthless in a country always at the verge of collapse but climate change can ultimately lead to displacement
sure i was getting at he did not forsee modern day climate change because people keep connecting socialism to modern day climate alarmism marx also is the only one to advocate for environmental conservation teddy roosevelt was a warmongering capitalist and he remembered as the face for environmentalism in america
i think the elephants are acting very holy here we humans deserve to get attacked for causing climate change
climate change is not that urgent if you have issues sustaining you existance right now in the present poor people do not care what happens in years they are far more worried about tomorrow
have you ever acted upon your urges to do anything to underage kids and do you care about the consequences you did no unless you count looking at legal modeling content see most pedos do even touch children the ones in the media are a minority at best we know if we did under the current climate it almost certainly fuck that child up i and others simply do want no part in that that why ultimately i believe if i want to have a romantic relationship with a child there has to be a change in culture at least to the point people would be okay with pedo relationships once that happens then i be okay with it be legalized but otherwise no the current culture will only fuck with the mind of the poor kid
i came to write pretty much this i travel a lot and making fun of trump is pretty common at every bar within eu when it comes to paris agreement people are getting extremely angry instead of joking i do think most people in us understands how different our view on climate change is compared to us the best solution imo even though it be hard would be emission tariffs on states instead of us as a country that way it might force other states to follow the agreement or companies will move to a state that does i honestly think that more people in eu would support trump getting a swastika tattoo than destroying the climate
what your opinion on his climate change policy or lack of circling back this is what was talking about with standard apologetics he incredibly dishonest we did elect him for what he says we elected him for what he does what has he done that so bad x y and oh those are so bad it like nothing he says matters because he on your side maybe what you believe in is so important that the ends or at least these ends justify the means in which case you could just start with yeah he full of shit but i really like xyz policies
thank god for climate change then
which will stop producing because of climate change so
same boat as you i only voting biden because of trump biden platform on gun control is way too extreme and not based on logic or data it to bad too because i agree with op the dems current platform on gun control prevents them from actually winning the seats they need to make meaningful change in healthcare and climate change
because our quality of survival will amongst others depend on the preservation of biodiversity and ecological processes clean water clean air buffers for floods preventing erosion and so so much more it an attempt to tackle all these problems of anthropogenic climate change in its entirety
to bad we turn whiskey back into water and carbon dioxide i for one would welcome a solution to climate change that required me drinking copious amounts of whiskey what are you drinking its on a tuesday i hic saving the planet dear
i agree that the consequences are bad and reflected in the original game too no jail time is not an option well it depends on your definition not convinced by that argument acting against class interest to benefit yourself will remain a problem even if you spread solidarity cause solidarity is just a social contract and not a material difference in itself sadly things like climate change etc are also prisoner dilemmas so you ca really resolve the original dilemma by factoring in costs that are themselves a dilemma if you wanna look into it you can extend the dilemma to an arbitrary amount of people and look at entire classes at once and this is just about the game not actually material reality in reality people reasonable and act against their interest all the time so convincing them of making the tradeoff you prefer need a logical foundation if morally willing to use propaganda the game is designed as a counterexample to the logic of a greater good anyway i enjoyed discussing keep up the videos
that said you do need the arctic camo if climate change just melts the icecaps taps head
it a movie plot come to life dismantle a country by installing my people at every level of goverment to poison and destroy eveything in their world take away their national parks water air ignore any climate change issues roll back future power solutions while cutting back on workers rights benefits education health care women abortion rights demoralize their vets by trashing their va and then ruin any trade and political alliances with other countries muahahhahah
i see you have the same canned dismissive attitude towards ben shapiro that you do with everything else that does fit your view if you watch the video you see how misplaced that characterization is i have provided sources because you are demanding sources for claims i am not making my statement you quoted this time is not a scientific statement that can be studied with any meaningful conclusion so i not sure what you hoping to see it an analysis of the future effect of a political policy so i explain the reasoning oil is so prevalent because it is the cheapest most reliable form of energy by a wide margin there are billions of people in the world that require cheap reliable energy to live simply forcing limitations on access to such a crucial resource results in millions of people around the world unable to heat their homes or get food or clean water to their community then since fossil fuels drive nearly every industry in the world the world economy takes a massive hit and organizations that fund relief efforts for those people will no longer have the money or means to do so there are already large amounts of people in the world heating homes with wood and dung because they ca even afford the cheapest form of energy and we would be sending a huge percentage of the world population into that level of poverty if they survive at all i would rather see the sea level rise one foot over the next century i believe that is the current ipcc prediction and that is only one example of a direct consequence having such a cheap and reliable form of energy makes everything cheaper and setting government imposed limitations directly increases the price of pretty much everything in the world conversely pursuing nuclear energy would lower the demand for oil replace oil with clean energy wherever it is used bringing down levels and making everything cheaper you keep mentioning a figure and attribute it to several different vague claims so let be clear about what there is a consensus on correct me if i wrong but i assume you are referring to the percent consensus cook et since that is the most popular this consensus is attributed to pretty much any statement regarding climate change that is convenient to push a policy or prove a point if you read the actual study which almost nobody that repeats it has done you will see that it is not a consensus on anything you have claimed in our discussion that is not to say climate change is real because virtually nobody thinks that the climate is changing the consensus is the result of a study which concluded that of scientists believe that the main cause of a degree increase over the past years is human activity it says nothing about preventative measures that have to happen and asserts absolutely nothing about the future of the climate it simply claims that a degree increase over years is mainly due to humans and even then the evidence is dubious since he includes papers that do claim the degree to which humans are responsible he calls explicit endorsement without quantification and papers that do even make the claim at all and the study just implies that it does he calls implicit endorsement several scientists included in that study have spoken out against it claiming their papers were misrepresented in that study still however that study is propped up by democrats at the highest levels to make claims the study itself does even claim to make in order to justify leftist policy if you are referring to some other consensus feel free to post a link similarly the link you posted has a very misleading standard for how they label someone a denier for example the evidence for both alaskans on there are statements from each that say that climate change is happening but we do know the degree to which humans are responsible this would ironically qualify for the consensus standard while qualifying for the denier label here and is by the way a scientifically accurate statement since there is no consensus on the degree to which humans are responsible so this actually proves my point about the false anti science stereotype being pushed by the left
but how big a problem is it do you think it a bigger problem than say climate change or infrastructure
thanks fire the answer having some of those terms will help clarify my search and even my goal i should clarify that i not looking for a program limited to climate change just one that has as one of its learning objectives or courses or faculty a focus on climate change
most of these politicians are nt idiots its their voters who are idiots edit to clarify an election is a popularity race if most of your voter base say they do nt believe in climate change and you say you do you run the real risk of losing the election because of that with this vote coming it plays the republican hand and its either you officially say climate change is nt real and get laughed at in the history books or you vote the yes its real which i am pretty sure most of them believe in
to be honest you are much much much more likely to be shot by a legal gunowner than you are to be attacked by isis in regards to climate change if you deny it you are unobservant

what a waste of natural resources they wanna end climate change getting rid of all these folks is a good start think of the carbon they save
climate change changes the climate but make the entire planet entirely uninhabitable is simply not possible many species will die but some will be able to adapt and continue to live that includes humans
it a hard truth and yeah most people do nt want to or ca nt confront something like climate change leading to planetary collapse sure there are still those of us who are trying but it be too little too late humans can not change a paradigm shift without crisis on a scale that can not be ignored humans collectively will address climate change on a level than means anything once and only once it becomes utterly impossible to ignore in other words a course correction of the human population on a global scale
i ignored this for a reason it a dumb observational question which if you frequent sites that discuss the issue every day it will seem from your pov that it as important as ever it not an issue that being raised often on a national news level at this time beyond the obvious of it being based on perspective how do i provide evidence of things not existing do i link to news outlets to show it not on their front page on this exact moment so you can retort with one that does because there thousands of outlets and many have pet projects some it will be climate change so ya i ignored your question because it dumb and is a follow up to anything i said i mean just you pointing out the use of the word relative shows how stupid your question is is the point you going to make right now is climate change is as prominent in the news today as it was around the time of the paris accords relax your self importance this was a commonly dodged point it was nonsense that did deserve an answer
or in other words we still do believe that our impact on climate change is big enough until there is evidence until then let just continue with all the shit that is going on while we pretend to be interested in finding this evidence just so we do look like the assholes we actually are they know about our impact it just that there is no profit in stopping polluting and exploiting the planet they know we all wo live long enough to really become endangered and just want to shift that problem on future generations
i feel the same way about this that i do about climate change people will make the necessary changes only after there is mass death
my mining engineering professor is a climate change denier it mind boggling
your comments appear to show you lean left democratic yet even saying one or the other is definitely not centrist which is obviously something you are not centrist the point of centrism is to not choose either of course even the most perfect centrist is going to have biases that when pressured will force them to choose one choice or another that one could argue points dominately left or right given each individual topic you mentioned about healthcare and climate in a previous comment as something you have noted that would tip centrists more towards a democratic viewpoint even if your personal experience has led you to believe that you are assuming that believing in either of those immediately means that centrists are a step away from being democratic your flaw is that you are putting much to great a weight into thinking that those two topics are all that needed to identify as democratic when in reality a centrist could for instance lean that way for those yet every other idea when pressured could lean towards a right leaning stance either way you missing the point of centrism of course there will be biases and i not going to argue whether those two you mentioned are more typical of a centrist or not especially considering that i too believe that that universal healthcare should be attempted here in the us with greater conviction while climate change is just something i believe we should all be conscious about yet i have no strong feelings towards but ultimately do i choose a sword to die on no because centrists spend their thoughts on reviewing both cases and view opinions and data among reasons for both as to why it should and why it should be one way or the other i said i lean more towards universal health care that in no way means i believe it the right way to do things and i realize i might be completely wrong to think that way which is why i am not passionate about it also until you dedicated a good portion of your time to studying such things why even form an opinion do you have case articles trialed examples and extenuating circumstances to back up your claims do you have justification for the groups that will suffer due to your decisions if you were hypothetically given the power to make such changes are you able to justify sacrificing some for the greater good what about the ones who get the short end of the stick how many is worth sacrificing thousand million how selfish are you to act like you have the say for even person that the problem with party systems or any group that claims to have all the answers there will always be others who bring up valid counterarguments if that was not true and the answer is as obvious then we would have this tug of war on all major issues literally that right there shows you how wrong you are for choosing a side and how pretentious you are for assuming you know best when there may be an equal number of people who claim opposite of your beliefs your trying to simplify things just does nt work on a centrist and you are honestly worse off for doing so yourself so fuck off i not trying to join your cult lol i do have a master and yours is obviously limiting you
they are deathly afraid that america is changing republican at recent climate change fake news
the same stupid false equivalency like bringing a snowball into congress to debunk climate change
i mean maybe even if someone is in the and denies any human participation then that does mean he wrong at everything if he cries foul because the other political extreme uses a tactic they accuse him of then ok why not that does make the former right it just makes both of them wrong i hate this generalistic camp thinking but i guess it human nature if you right at one thing you are right at all things and vice versa maybe i have some povs that i share with the worst dictators in history but so what if we claim to be scientific and objective then i believe we need to differentiate and avoid lumping people together i mean look at other answers to my comments people checked my profile and noticed that i conservative and immediantely throw the omg your x and y at me even under yours is one of them warning you of me another aborted a debate after noticing i conservative but accused the climate deniers of not listening in his post before you get the irony so yeah it sounds like you might be trying to downplay or refute climate change as a real danger i try to figure for myself if it is a real danger i just do know because there is so much evidence and so much political infection if you take the position of the it constribution people then it seems likely that our efforts to repair it also have a low impact man sometimes politics is a virus infecting everything i hate it
i think there more of an age gap than anything in medicine the older generation seems to be mostly conservative and the younger docs mostly liberal it makes sense its hard to commit your life to science and vote for a party that believes vaccines cause autism climate change is a chinese hoax and other idiotic statements
well no country is truly good all did evil however if you look at the last or so years or even starting with the obama administration politics are more for the people in europe and more for corporations in america look at title getting revoked how your leading political parties could not find a way to make medical care affordable to the common man because that might give the medical industry less profit in refugees ca really say that europe is doing much better than the us on that at the moment however for the self proclaimed best country in the world there is a lot more fucked up shit than in europe you can only fix problems you acknowledge you have like climate change
i seeing increase over years compared to roughly the same over however obama inherited the worst economy since the thirties while trump inherited a good and growing economy and the first year is based on the previous president affects um where are you seeing this please link me a source becuase mine says otherwise as does the wsj usa today and the heritage foundation of americans own stock but how much of that is an actual noticeable amount to their income i know a half dozen people with stocks i know with more than like a hundred dollars invested the vast majority of people who own stocks are not making any real money off of it ok even if its small its still a benifit the had increased that is just good for buisness and hiring and wages i already mentioned pensions and half of americans have a so you just have to admit this is helping people dude i m sorry trump did spurn the middle class he just has specifically made life worse for gon na talk about climate change here because whatever you believe economically climate change is more important than literally every other issue after inheriting a growing and strong economy trump choices have not been immediately disastrous but they not good choices in the long term for incomes and to increase that much is astonishing i will remind you to source your claim that income has only risen please because if its triple that will you admit you wrong also the fact half of america has stocks and half of america also has a is proof that record stock markets help the middle class trump rallies have day lines and hundreds of thousands of tickets sold you gon na have to take a look at the other side and listen one day
all candidates how will you help the us deal with the threat of climate change
i said it a lower priority not that she has to do them in strict order have some common sense the lengths you right wingers will go to try to discredit a year old who cares about climate change is insane
yeah that does change what i said i intend to change because i literally have no choice not only am i prime age for a draft the threat of climate change becoming my reality is too serious you can only cry no u for so long i done with this shit either do something or shut up i sick of it
the atrocious lack of yuri on this sub is the reason why climate change and shit like that has been addressed yet yeah those are big problemos but this subreddit lacking yuri is a next level problem
there was a jre recently on global warming that was interesting much more so than this to be fair joe and his guest did spend the entire time debating semantics on various climate change models so perhaps it was as fun
when life expectancy is but you finish it in because of climate change
did galileo galilei receive tax money from the government to work for their interest it was a vastly different time but to your point he was a professor and took grants from the pope church i do know enough about century italian sociopolitical systems to know if it could be considered a tax but from what i do know i think i could start googling some things up and make an argument that the power the church had in century italy was akin to government control tithing was a thing and could be considered a tax and as i write this out i realizing how perfect galileo was for you to use while op used funding climate change research as an example exxon funded research to debunk it and buried it when it did come out like they wanted similarly the catholic church did the same thing to galileo for his findings that they paid for well this comment did go the way i intended when i started
nuclear reactors bobbing around the arctic ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change said jan haverkamp nuclear expert for greenpeace central and eastern europe climate change which they helped ensure by opposing nuclear power at every turn
i think common people are probably fucked we deal with all of the problems and will lack the resources to protect ourselves from the changes that will come along with climate change
not op but the point of no return is more of a media fabricated idea than an actual point in time we ca fix climate change but we do have control over how bad it gets at this point we are locked into degrees of warming compared to pre industrial levels every conceivable trajectory will result in catastrophic ecological consequences that being said we do have some chance of avoiding an uninhabitable earth
the only reason naomi klein writes about climate change is because it a stick she can use to beat capitalism with
did you or did you stop once you saw what you wanted he goes on about how this is a conspiracy by climate scientists liberals to push their liberal agenda on climate change
the only reason we kind of avoided looking above the is the proximity to the river and potential flooding especially with climate change or is this not really an issue in that area
everything happening in the world climate change sudan ice muslim internment camps in china and probably a lot more i m missing i feel like no amount of goodness can outweigh the bad anymore we can always try our best to change things little by little but there will always be corruption i have little faith in humanity at this point
i believe the gulf stream is an ocean current and the jet stream is in the air i think i right in referring to the jet stream as it strongly impacts our weather though both could be altered by climate change and have knock on effects
well there actually is a continual threat to life on any planet whether or not a species can evolve and gain enough intelligence and societal willpower to get off that planet is kind of up in the air the main filters are things like natural asteroid impacts or man made stuff like climate change or nuclear disaster the fermi paradox also lies on the premise that these civilisations use radio signals for longer that we do it is a bit bizarre we have received anything y mistake i suppose when millions of years are nothing
the political will is here now but i do not doubt it will be in future especially if we do start to see worsening effects of climate change in the next few years putting the meat industry under scrutiny even if it is not banned outright i suspect governments will start taxing it more like they have for cigarettes alcohol and most recently sugar do discourage consumption
does summer eventually turn into winter bam climate change and i swear to god the first person who says not in the equator or some form of that i say must be nice
yea but that what i find alarmist about the whole thing practically speaking the scale should probably only cover the last minutes to midnight but it plotted on a twelve hour scale making it seem like we perpetually much closer to doomsday than we actually are also i not a fan of plotting long term existential threats like climate change on the same scale as short term ones like nuclear war nor am i confident the bulletin of atomic scientists is necessarily well enough versed in climate science to make a useful judgement as to how close we are to climate related doomsday
climate change may be real but it is within safe band what do you base that on
this sub is just about climate change that just one of the many reasons we hate cars
anti nuclear activism came out in europe after chernobyl which far preceeds any outstanding public knowledge that people had regarding climate change it is not like they came up with it to promote coal or anything people forget how frighting the fallout from chernobyl was plus at this point the existing nuclear power plant designs would take at least years to build all of these projects are notoriously over budget or delayed solar wind and storage we can deploy cheaply today we still do know how expensive the existing nuclear reactors will be since they are almost all running but decommissioning them will be an expensive nightmare once it starts the new modular nuclear reactors that people often cite literally do exist other than in untested prototypes so excuse me for not putting my money on that when we need a solution yesterday and we have lots of tested renewable options
it definitely will be harder to do anything in a world where fossil fuel companies destruction of the environment continues the rule of law requires a well functioning society which is under serious threat if our very survival as a species is ultimately at stake not doing what is necessary because some law prohibits it is foolish i already shown you these companies had the science and knew without being psychic about climate change a long long time ago the science was in long before that even but that makes their informed destruction of the environment for profit even worse the fact that other actors pollute as well does absolve the fossil fuel industry of guilt it pure whataboutism if the oil industry had lied and bought politicians we would likely have better energy solutions for these countries instead of coal
i do want kids i never have but the state of the world does help that lol but my sibling does they hoping to adopt most if not all of their future children and climate change is definitely a factor in that they have fertility issues so we do even know if they can have biological kids as they still quite young but even if they did they would rather give a loving home to a child or children who already exist and i think that great tbh
this group make any sense to have of vehicles idling for hours yeah that good for the climate my question is how are they all getting there by car car pooling public transit and how about zurawski all for this group and their bridge blocking exercise he the one who has major issues with idling for minutes meanwhile he supporting thousands of cars idling potentially for hours i have start stop and do use it to be honest there are probably other things they could be doing sure this is getting attention and is in the news but the climate change story is not top of mind period if they protest without blocking traffic good on them but i wo be there other than driving by in my truck rental
how easy for you to sneer and mock this when i doubt you cared enough to aid or study about these preventable famines over in africa before believe it or not the occasional drought is the main reason for chronic hunger in africa the true culprit is in a large part due to wasteful backward low farm productivity and unstable international markets but when china gives a shit enough to instruct them on modern farming practices and gives them funding and technology for it all you rather africans refuse the bread while you eat your damn cheetos and cake am i right stop discouraging these beneficial projects from the comfort of your living room sofa man china currently has agricultural experts serving in program food security in africa chinas new rice and has given million in assistance to the sector since this assistance ranges from major irrigation projects to donations of agricultural equipment other major chinese projects include the construction of numerous irrigation and canal networks including a massive canal connecting land locked malawi by way of lake malawi the second largest in the continent to rivers and dams in mozambique china provided training to african agricultural officials and eng zxxx subject areas included rural economic reform and development food production soil and water conservation and dry cultivation techniques the development of new cotton varieties the use of agricultural machinery and continuing education for agricultural teachers not only that but china just announced that china will pony up billion to help poor countries fight climate china climate change finance obama xi pledge
because california is being run by libtard idiots our state is going to go bankrupt and we have this shit going on and where is crazy uncle jerry out of the country working on climate change bullshit our state needs to get it shit together mr brown you are truly destroying this state
you missed my point their other ideas are insane no major party will co opt any of them unless they want to become unelectable themselves well that sounds like a win win centrists like myself who are concerned about climate change get to have that on the agenda and people who do like the greens other policies such as yourself get to keep those off it reform actually means change to improve not necessarily that the previous position was bad well fair enough the eu is a bit of a bad example as most acknowledged that it was a bit of a mess i still feel better for supporting brexit now and think the long term future is looking good i was never a staunch remainer anyway to be honest why do you feel better now what changed your mind
again i think the base line climate issues can be done in the agencies whose mission is to focus on that what agencies mission involves studying nature on a planetary level we already do this that is a major issue today too many agencies not coordinating how is the idea of stopping transferring research done by nasa addressing this issue or the issue of the science being too politicized beneifts helps other agencies in researching climate costs wasting nasa time when they should focus on space their mission other agencies can tackle climate change research the issue cited is the research is to politicized how is that being addressed do nasa officials complain and say climate research is a burden i see people say this is good so nasa can find us earth should the people who are suppose to find earth have the knowledge to understand planetary level eco systems however i will say that i have no idea how much cost burden it will be to realign this do worry deficits do matter when the gop is in charge to me though it seems like we will still be doing climate research so you think this is a good idea but you do know if we will study climate change but will also now be doing more space missions i see this as a net positive i support investing in all science and technology how is the idea the science has been politicized being addressed how are these additional space missions going to be paid for
oil and energy companies employ climate scientists and meteorologists they use them to plan drilling operations and new installations funny story leaked documents from exxon revealed that they privately accepted climate change decades ago they rather excited about how new reserves will be revealed by retreating polar ice they arrived at that conclusion with their own scientists it big tobacco all over again
but they would never have done that they the good guys who believe in science ask republicans and democrats questions about evolution and climate change and you see a clear divide about who tends to believe in science desperately wanting both sides to be equally bad does make it so
seems like you have some competition i always thought it would be ironic if as society collapses and abrupt climate change is well underway yellowstone erupted or an asteroid hit the planet something that would allow people to think in their final moments we were fucked anyways so it was our fault
the current state of climate change makes the truth undeniable unless we the working people stand up against the capitalist oppressors who caused and profited off of climate change all life on earth will suffer greatly from what may become a great extinction level event
i think humans are arrogant as possible to actually believe what we do has as major effects on the planet as some claim its simply amazing how full of ourselves we must be this planet has been around for billion years and has suffered much more horrific tragedies then the evolution of man anyone notice that since the the climate change does follow the increase decrease in gas usage but it does follow the sun activities as far as its energy output and radiation levels anyone stop to take a second when someeone mentions how much methane and carbion monoxide we shove into the atmosphere to realize that human are responsible for about of the methane and carbon monoxide made on this planet mother nature and other animals make up the other i not saying we innocent or that we do need to change our ways just stating that we are nearly as responsible for the amount of damage as many would have you believe
holy shit with a fire emoji that is so fucking morbid what a way to go i always have so much respect for the sorts of people who can do this in the name of a cause it takes so much faith in the act to spur others to action i want to use his death as a mean of getting more involved in climate change activism myself edit added on some thoughts
global warming climate change seemed obvious enough but apparently we need to call it satan caused human extinction fuckin pockyclypse pockyclypse mad max thunderdome reference maybe leave that out since mad max is awesome but an apocalypse is not awesome
i scoped your profile and you need to do yourself a massive favor and not go to collapse that place is an absolute cesspool climate change is real climate change is serious but we are making progress is it perfect no but the dystopian hellscape they practically celebrate and beg for over there is not healthy
in the grand scope of things beyond say creating art or music what have humans done that particularly worthwhile to the planet everything else we done aside from producing art and culture has been an utter detriment to the planet and all other species on the planet the most notable thing we accomplished is the ability to circumvent natural selection and overpopulate drastically i just do envision anything but us eventually causing our own extinction through climate change or facing mass turmoil and war over resources as they eventually dwindle
yeah no kidding all that drought is caused by climate change in ca pal reviewed indeed
al gore his presidency would have given us a year head start on climate change also i am curious as to how a clinton presidency would have altered the path of covid in the usa
an accurate been kids are taking obama and possibly to court over climate change but hey what a game without a spin
i agree with your insurance point fully but your first paragraph there is a bit flawed we could detonate all of the niclear warheads on our planet and earth would still be far more habitable than mars or the moon as well the worst case possibilities for climate change still have earth far easier to survive on than any other planetary body available to us there is simply no possibility for humans to make earth that uninhabitable we lack the technology it also extremely unlikely that nano machines will ever be a prevalent threat the fact is it not possible to pack enough power and processing power into such a small object to create a credible issue
he an anti democratic anti immigration anti equality anti infrastructure anti public health anti woman christofascist who happens to be interested in the uap topic even a broken clock is right twice a day i guess tim burchett voting record american rescue plan act of vaccine funding nay for the people act of protecting voting rights nay american dream and promise act of legal immigration pathway nay equality act prohibiting discrimination in federal facilities nay infrastructure investment and jobs act nay build back better act climate change healthcare housing nay women health protection act of safeguarding abortion rights from government attacks nay hate crimes act better management and reporting of hate crimes during covid nay impeaching donald john trump president of the united states for high crimes and misdemeanors nay
oh the numbers only tell part of the story read the names check out how many are diplomats or politicians connected in no way to key climate change areas check out how many are business owners check out how many are connected to politics at all and you can only look at their names and ask who check out how many are spouses this will give you an idea what that entourage was actually there for
religious nonsense notwithstanding this god fellow really should care about the already quarter million people a year dying from hazards created by climate change
but what else are you going by then political statements and funding by the oil and gas industry is the only opposition so you place trust in political statements and energy companies that have shown to falsify data when across a broad spectrum of scientific studies there is an agreement on man made climate change
i bet half of the dumb bastards would donate most of their million to climate change lolol
robert socolow reaffirms his stabilization wedges theory regarding climate change contrary to reports a few months ago that he now feels the wedges theory is a mistake this lays the science out quite well and also how to proceed forward in a way everyone can agree on here a quote confronted with unwelcome news human beings often shoot the messenger consider two earlier occasions galileo argued that the earth was at the center of the universe for this he was excommunicated darwin argued that human beings were part of the animal kingdom and he was cruelly mocked the idea that humans ca change our planet is as out of date and wrong as the earth centered universe and the separate creation of man but all three ideas have such appeal that they will fade away only very slowly
this is a rant post i do know if it just me but honestly getting tired of people replying in a hostile way to some of the things post said and downvoting anything that he comments it can be something as neutral as i like cats or his controversial opinions and this might come off as defending him kah or what but if i wanted to see drama i would just go on twitter where people are fighting incessantly there i do agree with some of the things he said sometimes and it not just him it with other redditors as well but i do make it a point to reply with no you wrong it this data that show bla bla bla or i hate you now so i downvote you opinions at the end of the day is your own opinion i know you ca please everyone and i not asking everyone to be guys let just stop fighting and eat cupcakes with rainbow sprinkles and live laugh love shit just saying that sometimes the best course of actions is to just simply ignore sure some of you will then say hoe you should ignore too i did but if only you knew the amount of eye rolling i did when i read some of what you guys comments the perfect meme to describe this situation is that meme where someone said something i like cats and other people will be like oh what now so now you hate dogs you hate rabbits you fucker who only spoil your cat and donate to other cats shelter but hate other animals and it like no fucker those two are completely different conversations so yes people everywhere are acting like that best to fuel those passions elsewhere like climate change yea peace out
it not the young people voting in conservative governments who do give a shit about climate change
based off climate chatter on this sub and flavor text these are my two guesses bad juju i really hope so i never use another primary hawkmoon of course this is the main speculation i included the info on both weapons so you can see that both flavor texts would add up for the story right now bad juju makes remarks from toland the shattered based on this the quest could be about a potential change in the curse cycle because we are coming to the end of it and opinion also the hawkmoon is to be used to let loose thy talons upon the darkness so it could be representative for light over powering the dark and fit the theme of revelry and breaking the curse please not another hand canon two blues and a hand cannon haha bad juju hawkmoon edit toland auto corrected to roland
depends on what you consider political vs reality these are reality and should be political lgbt people exist and that ok let them be do bully them nothing special just a part of society this country has a horrific history of racism that we should not forget evolution is real young earth creationism is a fairy tale and schools teaching this are an embarassment climate change is objectively a thing so you should learn about it
my comprehension is fine it you who is self aware if doing something against climate change is important the choice between a candidate who does nothing about it and one who does should be obvious to you
partisan hack hahhah i m not even from the states again all those lies yuo show about hillary are the typical politician lies stuff that you need to really dig into get sources and some are interpretations of the very bad trump is lying about stuff that you can just look out the window to fucking contradict he goes complete north korean dictator on his crowd when confronted he doubles down he even said he did nt say crowd was bigger then the same fucking week defends that the crowd was bigger lied about tweets that anyone can just look up lies about stuff said on camera again the difference is that trump is mentally ill he lies about things that only a child would lie about also the fact that he denies climate change means that anyone voting for him is a demonstrable idiot i know the left has its problems with gmo and nuclear but those are not black and white issues
this is the best i could make article us climate change new york military style marshall plan needed to combat climate change says prince charles reduced by i a bot min climate change poses such a severe threat that the only option is to adopt a military style response reminiscent of the marshall plan to rebuild post war europe prince charles said on monday a long time advocate for nature the british royal said climate change was rapidly becoming a that will dwarf the impact of the coronavirus pandemic with existing commitments falling far short of the kind of transformational action scientists say is now vital many advocates of climate action are urging governments to respond with the kind of urgency historically reserved for wartime extended r autotldr comments r autotldr version so far message pm and comments are monitored constructive feedback is welcome top keywords
the rights of non human species as collective entities outweigh those of individual human beings by what standard value judgement may be arbitrary but the standard we judge them by is objective the human life is in most systems the standard by which rights values and other intangibles are judged for the simple reason that we are humans and have no reason to make value judgement by any other yardstick the biosphere the totality of life on this planet is under an immediate threat brought on by the human species if we do not act very rapidly it will be too late to save most non human lifeforms i am not a climatologist biologist or other similar specialist however i believe that the majority of specialists in those fields would agree that while climate change is real and anthropocentric these claims of impending doom are wildly overblown my belief is compounded by your lack of peer reviewed scientific sources for this claim studies on what will happen to specific parts of the biosphere are not generalizable to the entire biosphere furthermore very rapidly is a meaningless phrase that is used by scare mongers with no serious evidence can you provide a time frame with significant testing and modelling that supports your conclusions and demonstrates that the rate of technological increase is not rapid enough to fit within your scale or did you just form a genocidal terrorist political philosophy based on meaningless phrases and doomsaying millenalism no solution that does not result in a rapid decrease in the human population has a reasonable chance of addressing our problem your reasoning for this claim seems to rely on your statement that if there was a techno fix out there do you think we would have discovered it by now which is a logical fallacy the same claim could have been used in the neolithic age to argue that since no one had discovered crop rotation agricultural civilization was clearly impossible without further evidence or reasoning there is no reason to accept this assertion specifically clandestine groups need to focus on developing novel pathogens capable of rapidly eradicating at least of the human population we have after a few decades figured out a solution to an important climate issue so your solution is to exterminate your own race hasty conclusions are one thing but this goes beyond the level of a simple logical fallacy and straight to sheer lunacy
what would be the general stance of a libertarian view on environmental regulations with the whole issue of climate change i feel like there is no other solution than strict regulations for lowering carbon output otherwise not enough people corporations care to make a change thanks for any clarification i still learning where i am as far as political identity
if you live in the west you likely see climate change worsening year to year it depressing
i also live in slc i recently learned that even just a few decades ago we had more weeks of freezing temperatures on average than we do today thanks to climate change we are losing our winter the winter storms also push out the smog yesterday i could taste the air
so instead of everyone pulling their own weight america should just pay for everything because otherwise it wo get done funny you leave out who leads the world in the reduction of emissions spoiler it the us by a large margin but hey the narrative that the us is super evil is really good with reddit completely ignore that the us was the first nation to reach reductions set out by the kyoto protocol without ever signing up for it completely ignore that the majority of the green energy technology and research is done in the us also your reasoning is very stupid climate change is a pressing issue that the west must deal with unless they want to deal with irreversible problems but hey the third world can still play catch up and pollute all they want oh and we have to pay them money i ask again if climate change is a real issue that needs to addressed why is the west the only one being forced to take any real action
so you saying i could go half vegetarian on these shit sausages being good for the environment is what i expected to turn climate change around but every little helps i guess
those people voted to gamble with the lives of every single organism on the face of the planet because they let their behaviour and beliefs be guided by childish feelings rather than any kind of reason or critical thinking or sense of moral responsibility they bad people they do deserve to suffer the impacts of climate change all on their own
i agree on his general point although i still think the weather is a somewhat misleading analogy as our relationship with the weather is very one sided there is no back and forth there at an immediate level things like climate change excluded of course regarding personal responsibility i think you can still put a huge focus on individualism if you choose to do so and not be a hypocrite for example if a society chooses to apply punishments it can apply them collectively which has certainly been a thing in many times and places to the family town community surrounding a wrongdoer or it can apply them only to the individual s who specifically perpetrated a criminal act the same with rewards you can issue a patent and the monetary rewards that go with it to individual people or you can have a more collectivist model surrounding intellectual property for example another example people can be enculturated to feel that either lower or higher levels of group support when completing a task are socially appropriate the self starter model the synergy model when discussing rewards punishments and support you can be absolutely draconian or a total flower child but in either case still draw the boundaries of where the proximate cause of an act is around individual people or around another entity again perhaps a family tribe city town nation etc for practical purposes everyone ends up drawing a rather arbitrary boundary somewhere or other in summary i think the discussion of individualism in the west is an interesting one but not necessarily dependent on the idea of free will just like i think the question of how mild or harsh punishments as deterrents should be is an important one but not necessarily dependent on the idea of free will either
he say something about climate change or against trump next week and be hoisted back onto his pedestal by the left the fervor for the catholic church was nuts last year when he said anything seemingly anti trump
i believe there merit to what he hillary is too hawkish and spontaneous for me and a big part of why i not voting for her is due to her seemingly inappropriate changes in policy bernie is also incredibly liberal voted against the iraq war and if elected president has said that military force would be the last resort as the world strongest military i believe that americans should realize that everything we do has an both to us and to the countries we attack cruz and the rest of the republican side have said a lot about military force but they have addressed the effects of invasion like to our veterans they like to talk about invading other countries taking names and stomping heads but veterans are a vocal point of their campaigns to me it seems like an afterthought added on to satisfy the average american hillary voted for the war in iraq but she likes to overlook this and whenever it comes up she always dodges it by pinning the blame on the bush administration i can understand that bush did say there could have been nuclear weapons there but the invasion itself literally did not need to there was no concrete evidence of wmds but even so there were already un inspectors searching for nuclear and chemical weapons in iraq and they were doing a pretty good job of forcing iraqi cooperation up until bush forced them out of country he also wants to implement single payer and make drug imports legal drugs from canada etc are way cheaper than drugs in the us something i really excited for additionally a push to prevent or reduce climate change expansions to the va programs and a minimum wage are all part of his agenda
what drives me up the wall when i was on facebook was ben and jerrys promoting some event or campaign to end climate change uhm yeah this is kettle calling for mr pot
not having kids climate change has no bearing on my decision i hate kids
iirc did gerta thunderborgar do the same thing as well whenever she went to certain events on climate change and of course the media said nothing about it as well
ad hominem really do knock on other people from that glass tower of yours i work days a week and shitpost a lot when i bored which is quite often and i recognise that i privileged while i eating my rack of ribs atm moving onwards most people do eat grains legumes and vegetables as their main sources of nutrition i never denied that but they also consume meat fish insects and fungi to supplement their diets to go fully vegan is to eschew important nutrient sources that you otherwise can not acquire outside of consuming supplements vitamins and quite frankly a lot of people just like meat for the taste texture no stopping those people and i one of them i think that most vegans oppose the consumption of meat and dairy on an ethical basis because of how poorly the treatment of livestock and domesticated animals bred for food are treated that fine and dandy but veganism is an individual choice with your argument you are convincing the vast majority of the population of people to stop consuming meat dairy i think it an exercise in futility to do so not to mention that meat dairy has been used in culinary dishes and has a great deal of cultural history tied to them i do appreciate you trying to virtue signal your vegan goodness in opposition to my capitalistic evulz i being practical about the facts edit besides we all most likely be dead in years given climate change upcoming resource wars economic instability
meanwhile germany nearly stopped having winter because climate change
short term gratification chances are the party and most voters are long gone when the effects of climate change is fully realized appealing to their voters the older richer generations tend to have money or agendas tied up to corporations that will may be impacted by drastic changes
the results are irrelevant if pollution was a significant factor then these asians living in the most polluted cities on earth would be crushing iq tests it kind of a perfect liberal talking point after which you could conceivably say that climate change is why blacks do do relatively as well on iq tests on average
the eton educated elite is totally on your side because he has messy hair the other guy asked us to be a bit more conscious about climate change and nicer to the more vulnerable in society and we ca have any of that woke nonsense now can we
rand paul is a conspiracy nutjob who does not believe man made climate change exists and thinks vaccines can cause autism how could you support a candidate or party with such unhinged ignorant stances
you did address the supreme court and as for your opinion on obamacare forgive me if i do share it with my patients that rely on it to survive you also do have any evidence to suggest he does currently care about lgbtq people or climate change but if you look you find plenty of evidence for those claims against trump put simply would you actually prefer trump over biden because that the argument it sounds like you making
to be fair the green party is a gop front group designed to torpedo democrats in elections by splitting the votes and therefore torpedoing any climate change action so sinema is being corrupt here
do shoot the messenger but that statement applies to much more than climate change
a book i ca interpret or verify says so look asking questions about something is fine asking why do you interpret the data to say that is a valid question being a skeptic does mean you just ask questions if you do understand the data or the interpretation look up information and learn do just sit back and say i do understand therefore it bullshit which is all you doing you are being a skeptic you being a stubborn fool it obvious that you clearly are interested in fully understanding the issue but that you solely interested in saying i do understand so it bullshit scientists do believe anything scientists take a hypothesis make observations and determine whether the observations support the hypothesis furthermore scientists use their hypothesis to make predictions and if those predictions turn out to be correct and the evidence supports the hypothesis then the hypothesis is accepted not believed the scientific method is not a belief system should follow it blindly no no scientist actually says that a scientist will tell you that the evidence points to the conclusion that manmade sources have caused and are causing climate change you are encouraged to make an effort to investigate how that conclusion was reached not believe it blindly
i wanted bernie to be the nominee but to abandon ship in spite of biden is just ensuring four more years of trump in life we must play the hand we are dealt and in this case that means pushing for biden at least with a biden presidency these issues will come up and be debated by policymakers let me remind you that trump administration actively removed information pertaining to climate change from government websites biden plan for the environment will still be far better than the complete neglect four more years of trump will cause if that not good enough for you consider that a lot of the future legislation reforming health care or how we treat the environment will have to come before federal judges because you know republicans and corporations will sue to make those bills unconstitutional do you really want trump and pence appointed judges ruling on those cases down the line any future progressive legislation is far more likely to survive biden appointed judges and that my friend is why we must defeat the idiotic and dangerous candidate the gop has stuck in our white house
i not contradicting it at all the implication was that a green deal means shutting down the economy that is false nevertheless it probably will mean a slight hit to growth in the short term on top of that the fantasy of the status quo brigade is that doing nothing wo lead to even worse economic damage in the future it is irrational if you follow the science on climate change economic damage is what we are working towards right now we can lessen that damage by converting to a green economy earlier it is denialist fantasy to asssume that climate change wo cause economic damage if we continue business as usual
i was just of the opinion it painted a unrealistic view of society and how people would react to a asteroid the movie is about an asteroid though it about climate change so that makes sense why it felt that way to me but if you disagree that okay too
so my dick sorry i all for serious action on climate change
it not we live in democracies that means that the desire of the voting population is important you seem to be mistaken in believing that the majority of voters care about climate change you wrong many do but a great many do and their opinions are constantly fought for both in person and online there bots sock puppets and genuinely misguided people who campaign for entirely nefarious causes this is exactly why shit like trump and brexit happens because we have a population where a great many people are incredibly stupid and are open to holding very terrible ideas it not just a matter of blaming leaders those leads are supported by millions of idiots
that phenomenal gdp would come along with the destruction of our local environment and contributing to climate change i rather not thanks
i still curious who at marshall space center told old mo there was no such thing as climate change maybe the janitor
the reason we ca eat such a high meat diet in warmer climates is because we have to cook our meat can you provide a source for this i do think it a matter of warmer climates lacking meat it a matter of frigid climates lacking plant matter and sugar roughly of inuit wiki are sucrose intolerant meaning they are completely unable to digest it which is saying a lot for such a common substance and the fact that they all descend from equatorial people in the first place plains americans for example subsisted off of bison to the extent that white settlers brought the animal to extinction in order to kill the natives off that is definitely not a cold climate it is solidly temperate or something similar i think it has more to do with the fact that cold climates favor small populations and small populations mean less competition for resources so darker skin is allowed to flourish due to d rich animal diets at least until you get invaded by agricultural pastoral peoples who change the lifestyle to a lacto vegetarian one which favors light skin like what happened in europe over the last years dark skin is essentially a biological luxury similar to a large body or other features that indicate a wealth of resources at least it acts that way in the shadier climates lastly there is also the issue of fish meat fish have higher vitamin d levels than meat which of course have higher levels than lactovegeterian foods so marine based peoples are usually going to be darker than any other groups when holding latitude constant you can sort of see this in action in paleolithic europe the further west you went the darker the europeans were and of course the west has far more marine resources and a longer coastline
i do like kenney but he is a climate change denier he literally mentioned acting on climate change in his victory speech will he do anything about it probably not also there is a big leap from hating greta to approving this sticker i have seen anyone approve what the sticker shows and i work with some super redneck albertan motherfuckers
i was on r antinatalism and i found your post someone commented that talk about climate change so let do it you not having kids wo stop climate change but we can all work together to fix the problems of today so the next generation can have new problems so they can solve their problems not having kids is going to solve anything but solving the problem for future why i said you guys are nihilist you do want change you do want to improve anything you are just here to if this got too harsh
please tell me how i going to compromise with voters of the party that as of right now literally holds all the power denies climate change has a president that does believe in vaccination has a vp that wants to put gay people in therapy puts children into cages claims to be for small government but spends trillions of useless dollars on the military wants to undo pretty much everything the dems have done actively lies to the public and shuts down any and all conversations about anything that goes against their narrative

my god did you really need all caps for this it makes you sound like you investing way too much emotionally in defending elon musk do you need to get so worked up in defending him i only going to respond to certain parts of this for the simple reason that there so much to cover there no such thing as bad pr this is patently false and is a lie repeated by idiots there is such a thing as bad pr and it calling a hero a pedophile because he did like your ipod submarine ranting about fake news on twitter and then openly lying to investors before being fined million dollars for lying i do see how any of that is good pr for elon he a scientist no he is he will go down in history for sparking the electric car revolution assuming there will be an electric car revolution instead of say a public transport revolution or a hydrogen fuel cell revolution or a actual revolution it a bit soon to say if there is a revolution and definitely too soon to credit any one person for starting it i could just as easily assign it to the people that actually founded tesla or to researchers who have found better batteries the model is coming proof he has been doing this only years ford has been doing it for years and how is that an excuse for him throwing the entire textbook on how to make cars out the window and surely he have learnt how to properly build cars in say years not cars a week going is cars an hour how do they do that it a modern marvel ford made model t every day in it not modern and it not a marvel it mass production yes i know a model t is easier to make but manufacturing tech has advanced massively since then you think that tesla could manage a week if ford could do a week with technology i know people who work at tesla and spacex they love it if you do like it just quit fuck me not the if it so bad why do you just leave argument you know people work shitty jobs they hate because they have to or do all mcdonald workers choose to work there the guy who shovels shit onto a landfill does he stay there because he loves his job or because he needs money also that anecdotal evidence i do know for certain that you have friends that work there but even if you do and they love it that does invalidate the shit reveal found why is he doing this in response to my point about him not actually working his arse off gee could it possibly be that he wants even more money do you think people just make money and then are suddenly perfectly content with what they have no they want more you making that up lol no i slightly condensed this point elon has multiple companies therefore he needs a private jet to manage them have you ever heard of this thing called email or a telephone or perhaps he could drive his tesla if he really needs to be there i sure he does need to be at spacex every day right or at solarcity unless he handles all annual orders of solar city shit personally he probably does need to be at tesla tbf though does require him to fly everywhere people like to drive indeed but as has been previously established the mindset of keeping cars enables the extremely dangerous belief that tackling climate change requires no action on our part i sure that if i said we need to stop dropping nukes to prevent climate change no one would say but people like dropping nukes that the kind of stupidity this argument is buses are uncomfortable dirty and dangerous and will always be like that that a straight up lie and you know it not sure what the bus services are like where you live but here in england they clean safe well run and comfortable the idea that bus services are never going to improve is such straight up bs i ca believe someone would say that rich people drive tesla rich people can be exceedingly stupid the suggestion that they drive them therefore smart people like tesla is a non sequitur that assumes rich people are inherently smart and that poor people are inherently dumb that is downright offensive and certainly patronising also and here a thought maybe rich people are buying tesla because they expensive and they are therefore seen as a status symbol no but most of the negativity is misguided ahah so now you admitted there are criticisms of musk that are legitimate care to elaborate on them also you did address that i had called you out on your blatant strawman and instead just said some bs about most opposition to musk being wrong without elaborating on why they wrong i known people with phds that ca tie their shoes what does this have to do with you alledging that all smart people like musk or are you saying you personally know every single person with a phd who does like musk and that they all ca tie their shoe laces just saying some people with phds are dumb does do anything to counter the point of many smart people have called out musk he changing the world bubba please do call me bubba and how exactly is he changing the world in a quantifiable provable way he just as weird as edison and hughes and willy wonka great i do get what him being weird has to do with him being a genius or not unless you saying he weird some geniuses were weird therefore genius well i sorry but there are also weird people that are geniuses lee langer sits on a bench and sniffs glue sticks all day does make him the next einstein

i had a bunch of experiences in the past with people who took interest in loud fast cars and almost all of them where pretentious and arrrogant you seem chill but honestly there are really people out there who overcompensate for a lack of self worth due to whatever reason possibly even penis size or lack of attention in the childhood i do know you at all so i do know if you are arrogant the thing is that i always hated arrogancy and for a long time i did even know that i myself was embodying a specific kind of arrogancy so i think it would be a bad question to ask you if you are arrogant because you only have your own perspective on this and one perspective is by far not enaugh anyways i can see the apeal in liking machines and engines i understand why someone would like the sound of a working engine as a representation of a masterpiece of engineering i can see the apeal in going fast in a car being able to feel like the top of the food chain and the adrenaline rush but it is a waste of fosil fuels to just drive around for the sake of it and to be honest when i was in college there where constantly assholes who would drift on the roundabout right in front of my school and distract all the students form learning it is so incredibly fucking annoying and unnecessary that i feel like no matter how strong your passion for it is either supress it or look for something else to be passionate about i am interested in poetry i write lyrics because there is no waste no pollution no annoyment i get something out of it i can explore my creativity and individuality if that would be the other way around i would look for something else no matter how passionate i am about it i absolutely hate formula for this exact reason it is a rich people sport that is just a waste of time and resources humanity is fighting with climate change and lack of resources and then there are people setting gas on fire just because it sounds nice and it looks good the carelessness about climate and resources infuriates me alot more than the passion one might feel for doing it i know there are bigger sources of polution like planes and electricity production but that does excuse the carelessness about it people are spending time and money to go extinct as loud and fast as possible because they are passionate about it fuck that
i really really really hope this is true i mean it really nice that the eu and other international organisations are doing more to combat climate change but honestly if there a chance of europe making a comeback it need a strong economy
i start with the premise that coercive laws have to be morally justified if this is a moral issue then it can not be used to justify any coercive laws such as environmental standards for instance what i would say is that this is an issue of long term human welfare if we allow climate change to happen to a really serious degree say greater then degrees c of warming this century then it is going to negatively impact the lives of hundreds of millions of people maybe billions of people and yes of course there is a moral issue there when we talking about human welfare but it not like fossil fuels are evil burning them is wrong a better way to think of it is we are going to have to leave about half of the fossil fuel reserves we know of underground and unburnt in order to avoid the really catastrophic effects of climate change how can we get there from here how can we transition our energy system over to a point where we cut carbon emissions in half by and eliminate them by about and do it without destroying our economy or reverting ourselves back to a pre industrial era level of standard of living because of course having a total collapse of our current technological and economic system would also be an issue of human welfare that would impact the lives of billions of people so we also want to avoid that i also like how you in favor of creating the most long lived externalities there are nuclear waste nuclear waste is a managable problem if handled correctly even if you did care about climate change at all nuclear power plants are still much less of an environmental issues in other ways then coal plants from coal mining and the way that destroys rivers to the air pollution the coal plant creates to the mercury and lead that ends up in the oceans and so on and so fourth maybe at some point we can phase out nuclear plants too and go to a totally renewable system but that a much lower priority then phasing out fossil fuels so why get rid of burning coal but not of insert random other activity that causes greenhouse gas emissions what about the people who make profits with burning coal what about the people who just love burning coal coal is the biggest problem like i said it pretty much our dirtiest energy source if we going to leave half of the fossil fuels we know about underground which we will need to do then it makes sense to first avoid mining coal and doing things like mining tar sands basically stop the dirtiest and most inefficient sources of fossil fuel energy first and then work back from there eventually by say or so we need to get to a place where all our electricity is either nuclear or renewable where our cars and trains are electric or something similar and basically where we no longer burn fossil fuels but we going to have to get there in stages it going to be a huge job
as a result legislators may feel more freedom to support free trade based on the strength of the consensus among economists that it is generally beneficial for the country oh gee what a travesty politicians are doing things that experts in the field recommend if only they did the same for climate change lol
i hear ya fellow human shit rough out there but we just dumb apes hurtling through space and who the fuck knows anything hell if someone told me that my death to coronavirus would help humans in realizing the importance of getting away from capitalism and buy us a few more years to prevent extinction by climate change i accept that in a heartbeat and gladly rip maybe there karmic lessons to be learned in all of this maybe it a chance for all of us to be challenged in ways we never expected and thus grow as individuals either way grilling sounds awesome
climate change is actively happening right now you fucking idiot
here his issues the one that stands out is environment the environment is a precious gift and needs to be protected gov johnson believes strongly that the first responsibility of government is to protect citizens from those who would do them harm whether it be a foreign aggressor a criminal or a bad actor who harms the environment upon which we all depend consistent with that responsibility gary johnson believes it is the proper role of government to enforce reasonable environmental protections he did so as governor and would do so as president however gov johnson also believes that it is not the proper role of government to engage in social and economic engineering for the purpose of manipulating the energy marketplace or creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market such efforts have failed in the past and are doomed to continue to fail preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing deciding in washington dc that one source of energy should be subsidized and others penalized is a different matter in a healthy economy that allows the market to function unimpeded consumers innovators and personal choices will ultimately bring about the environmental restoration and protection society desires conversely destroying prosperity and innovation through government intervention will only harm the environment when it comes to global climate change gov johnson believes too many politicians are having the wrong debate is the climate changing probably so is man contributing to that change probably so the important question however is whether the government efforts to regulate tax and manipulate the marketplace in order to impact that change are cost effective or effective at all given the realities of global energy and resource use there is little evidence that the burden being placed on americans is making a difference that justifies the cost yes he goes on to say that the government should subsidize or penalize certain forms of energy but the fact that he favors regulation for the environment at all makes this statement anti regulation at all costs and allowing corporations free reign absolutely false
i hope someone informs him that applies to climate change too
no i do want to argue with someone that is objectively wrong you just going to throw out some fringe climate change denier video and think that proves anything while ignoring the fact that of climatologists agree that the climate is changing due to burning carbon it would be no better than arguing with a holocaust denier if you have seen the evidence for what it is you sure as wo see it because i point it out
sadly satan was recently killed by climate sound warning otherwise i agree
the planet will be livable regardless of what happens it this type of do as i say or you die argument that makes climate change skeptics deniers double down on their position
well it coud be that instaed of a respectable republican like mccain or romney trump is a pussy grabbing rich kid who loses a billion dollars who qualifications would land him a real job beyond a manager at a burger stand who election was the result of russian interference and propaganda who handlers are either crooks or kooks who needs to have the leaders of other nations tutor him on eight grade level history who blatantly ignores conflicts of interests to enrich himself and his family who appoints his mute wide eyed son in law to oversee projects with responsibilities that qualified people would have a challenge with who mind wanders in to a tangle of weeds within a split second of being asked a standard question or it could be that everything that trump does seems to agree with russia they rely on fossil fuel to feed their economy global warming caused by the very thing they sell is a problem so trump and the russians dismiss climate change war and conflict raise oil prices and so russia and trump both seek to increase conflict around the world oligarchs made obscenely wealthy by a corrupt political system in russia want no part of a unified world where carbon tax and sensible long term thinking guide policy trump who is probably deeply in debt to these oligarchs criticizes the very organizations nato the european union and the us state department have brought world peace for so many years the man is the problem this sub is the result
i and have been thinking about whether or not the stock market is a safe bet for a while because of climate change everyone says things are going to get bad in and i just do see how that wo affect returns so this does surprise me i going to place a bigger emphasis on investing in real estate than a lot of people in the fire community seem to do i hoping that land and houses in cities that have been affected by climate change will become more valuable as some places become less habitable but i do worry that the economy will start to fall apart as climate change worsens and people just wo have the income to afford housing and rent prices which will cause the value of everything to go down because of lack of demand i feel like we already seeing people opt out by getting tiny homes and living in vans i starting a homestead with my partner and investing in practical tools like a sawmill and land with extra trees for firewood so we can decrease our reliance on food utilities etc hopefully we can get our costs as low as possible and not really need a whole lot of income sorry for the rant i just do see a lot of people talking about this kind of stuff and the fact that we facing so many obstacles as a generation and will be alive when climate change starts to get really bad just makes me feel like i playing a losing game it demotivating and just makes me want to go down to a part time job and farm and try to enjoy life instead of providing security for myself which feels like an illusion at this point
do donate to them yet first look at all the things you can do in your life that will drastically help the efforts if everyone keeps counting on under supported non profits to make the difference or off set their foot print things will never change but if you doing all you can to effect climate change than look at the differences between the top and see which difference matters the most to you personally
i do think in this political climate that a massachusetts republican can win unless people really hate the democratic party candidates they are way too centrist for either party as a result if they were to try they would have to change a lot of their positions which would make it even harder to win because it looks like flip flopping i think a massachusetts republican could absolutely win a general election in this political climate i just think a massachusetts republican ca run on a massachusetts republican platform and still win the republican nomination it dammed if you do dammed if you do for the republicans the democrats do a better job at nominating centrist candidates some would say that a bad thing but that for a different discussion and not having a climate that forces the democratic field to cannibalize each other and change views during the primary season to stay afloat on the other hand and as an ancillary note the republicans are much better at filling legislative seats across the country at least in the last decade or three
it not climate change that does that monopolies existed before climate change was a thing and with the repeal of the glass steagal act about years ago now it never been easier for big business to have immense control over government legislation that act was a small part of it for sure it just a very easy thing to point to hey i pretty thrilled i got you to call me crazy though you seem so mad when other people call you that
but conservative judges you ok with well you better be because there wo be any laws on the books about climate change or medicare with a country full of conservative judges but you do you
that what capitalism has brought politics in the united states to just ad hominem because there could be no debate about which system is better otherwise the capitalists would lose everything and have to do productive work capitalism is not conductive to reasonable discussion that why we still arguing about climate change and trying to deny women reproductive freedom
i used to think capitalism provided a healthy sort of competition but i no longer do socialism or at least some sort of state capitalism is the lesser of two evils free market capitalism is the main reason climate change is continuing uncontrolled
man controlled climate change is the argument not just climate strawman much
you literally described maxime bernier but oh no he supposedly far right his policies are exactly what you want he does care about race or identity politics and aims to love all canadians including people he simply believes that people should be old enough to make those decisions and not be pressured in school at a young age he wants to massively decrease immigration for a couple of years to give him time to rebuild the canadian economy he also has a full platform of tending to indigenous people as well he wants to get rid of all taxes related to climate change and actually put policies like cleaning our oceans and lands ppc as a party believe climate change is legitimate but does not believe the scare that is being perpetuated amongst the left and the conservatives and he fucking hates the conservatives for being sell outs so you can be rest assured that this man is a fully blooded populist give him a chance
why should they be ashamed of the headline it not denying climate change is real
it best to ignore those people you wasting energy when you talk to them there is nothing you could ever say that would even remotely give them the chance of altering their thinking so why bother it like the political climate in the us right now you have brainwashed leftists shouting down anything right of stalin screaming insulting and resorting to attacks there is no possibility of discourse with them you never change their minds they enter into the debate with the intention of getting triggered before you even open your mouth granted it the same with a lot of people on the right too but that illustrates my point are dangerous does matter how far left or right they are when people buy into some group label it creates imbeciles that can not think for themselves and abandon critical thought in favor of hivemind groupthink feminism is just one of the many ideologies that is spreading toxicity into our society it has roots in marxism so that not surprising these people are so brittle so insecure that they can not even entertain a different point of view fact not only ca they entertain it they ca tolerate it so do even engage you just wasting brain cells
climate change has existed since the formation of our planet itself the earth has gone through many cooling and warming cycles during billions of years some lasting hundreds to thousands of years this nothing new it just another natural cycle we only been an industrialized world for roughly years do you honestly believe that we could effect the earth more in this short time than nature with it multitude of volcanic eruptions earthquakes storms etc has done for the billions of years prior not likely yes climate change does exist it the alarmists and extremists that are turning the molehill into a mountain and it all in the name of making money usually from those gullible enough to believe the propaganda even the ipcc the international commission on climate change is taking back its own claims the global temperature is actually dropping not rising climate change alarmists need to fuck off and get their facts straight join us over at climateskeptics
this is applicable to moderate dems across just about any topic climate change do care wo live through the worst of it police violence do care cops do roll up and start shooting in my gated community those poor people should learn to listen to the cops student loan debt do care went to college was able to pay my loans housing costs do care own a home that tripled in value
climate change induced migration is going to cause right wingers in the us and europe to attempt to outdo the holocaust by a few orders of magnitude over the next few decades
so if thunderstorms create ozone and global climate change increases storm intensity does that mean shell and bp are responsible for healing the ozone layer
well it was oil then the ac man to help you stay cool from the climate change the oil man brought the next will be a water man for all the droughts the ac man helped with the ac power needs
the world is not black and white which one is more legitimate to talk about climate change a vegan who drives his car every day and travels by plane every month or a non vegan who eats meat once a week does use a car and never travels by plane
you should be puzzled we can start doing something about climate change now which will be expensive or we can stick our head in the sand and then have to do very very quickly to avoid disaster and that is really going to cost and probably more than money it will cost lives taxation overspending and inflation will seem very distant when you underwater or on fire
if you do have a degree in climatology or environmental science shut the fuck up you chromosome packing long hair smelly lazy fucking reject i work with real ones they mock gretta granted they agree climate change us real but paying off european dickwad politicans is the answer peta sierra club and greenpeace should be placed on a terror watch list they actually have documented acts of terror and do deserve protections doctors should be prohibited on refurrals and drug prescriptions when you move to a new state do nt make it like the old one for fucks sake one thing to be a raiders lakers fan it another to push your stupid fucking states policies onto us specifically i mean californians and new yorkers shut the fuck up and be glad you re not paying a gallon so senator turdburgler can go on boondoggles lifted trucks with skinny tires stacks in bed carolina squat with dubs your existence is pointless your father abadoned your frost tip dumbass for a reason being a entrupenur is nice being a instagram i bought semis entrupenur no you just being poor faster promote your business like a real company highlight your route like a real company by the way do get pissy when i coming from that side or the world brings the cold harsh reality to you you gon na be drug screened you gon na be audited tickets are expensive as fuck the new laws pushing evs onto us is asinine and the people pushing them should be investigated for conflict of interest a fat communist is a lying sack of shit that needs to be treated like the bourgeoisie swine they are peaceful protest is nt smashing windows out and robbing people that a riot people who make penis remarks about guns and trucks what your creepy interest in that person genitals like do you like fat rednecks topping you like seriously do you get out of your hypocrisy mobile hang out by a glory hole with a ruler and scream do you own a dodge show me your pee pee like for fucks sake if you ca be original on insults and thinking you on the high road i got bad news you ass stomped a land mine in the septic tank pedophiles rapist child abusers animal abusers do deserve human rights grammar nazis who do do the whole process of correcting or forgot punctuation do the honorable thing and gag on a dictionary you halfwit bastard child of a inbred ponce every time ur not you hurrrrrrr seriously honorable thing is to fall on your own blade
humans love to put things in simplistic boxes especially complex complex ideas crt is racist and wrong nah it a very nuanced subject climate change is straight forward nope it a multidisciplinary scientific problem that we are trying to fully understand
a not so small group of people do believe in evolution or climate change i think public opinion only slightly points to the majority of americans believing in both those scientific facts
biochar is good in places like the amazon but apparently the type of biochar soil we are talking about now to fight climate change and to build soil is not the same thing and can actually increase emissions
there a big locust infestation in east africa happening right now destroying a buncha crops too likely worsened by climate change
i think that this person is referencing the fact that bill gates said that we needed to block some of the sun to prevent climate change implying bill gates is a leftist
china is governed by a communist party but their mode of production is still capitalism there are no socialist countries regarding the rest i quote john bellamy foster today planetary ecological crisis is due first and foremost to the increasing scale of the capitalist world economy the greater the scale of the economy the more it rivals the fundamental biogeochemical cycles of the planet all of this is connected to the nature and logic of capitalism understood as a system directed at the accumulation of capital capitalism is a grow or die system if accumulation declines the result is economic crisis the answer of the system is to boost accumulation this however intensifies global environmental crises as the already visible impact of the economy on the earth system increases
if you live a middle class life with middle class goods you absolutely are the one benefiting from climate change how do you think your iphone gets to america sail boats
the fact that its degrees out educated me i do nt need no california warmth and sunshine climate change propoonent on
i have a completely different perspective america is going down a dark path and i genuinely believe that american democracy will cease to exist in the next years climate change is not gon na get better more people are talking about it yeah idk about that one the only thing being done is promises by nation states and corporations that they will achieve certain goals by a date far in the future but by that point it will be far too late it already is far too late the average lifespan in the united states went down last year the largest drop since world war our freedoms are eroding as the us further adopts a police surveillance state mental health is at an all time low due to social media misinformation is at an all time high due to social media distrust in authority is at an all time high the economy seems to fluctuate on the whim of people tweets i could keep going but yeah from my perspective things are definitely getting worse and will continue to do so
i been saying this the earth is a wet rock it does care climate change is gon na fuck humans and also we always point fingers but to some extent we all to blame
you know something that contributes to climate change like a lot agriculture
you ca take everyone to mars and assuming mars would be the place to go is something ever happens to earth that a major issue i not following your reasoning musk is suggesting that we all pack up and move to mars the idea of having colonies on other planets is that in case humanity or life in general on earth goes extinct we have a backup the fact that not everyone will be saved is besides the point not everybody around the world can afford whatever medicine they need that does mean we should stop investing in pharmaceutical also humans can barely care for earth and musk wants to colonize another planet does make sense i still not following of course we should take care of our planet i think everyone on vegan will agree i unsure what that has to do with the colonization of mars one of the reasons we should colonize other planets is because we failing at protecting this one so we should have backups as an insurance policy if your objection to colonizing mars is that we will also fuck up the martian environment than i have two points in regards to that nobody is talking about terraforming mars any time in the near future our technology and knowledge is remotely advanced enough to attempt doing that we only talking about building small isolated colonies even if we were terraforming mars there no ethical issue with that imo the reason why fucking up earth environment is so unethical is because there are billions of humans and trillions upon trillions of animals suffering due to climate change deforestation overfishing etc changing the martian climate to be more habitable is negatively impacting a single sentient creature a lump of rock is not a moral patient on its own no matter if it a pebble or the size of a planet
presiding officer it is showing that on the day on the climate protests when the secretary of state and the leader of the scottish conservatives joined students and sent them a positive message the greens were agitating for separation no longer are they a single issue party of environmentalism indeed the need to protect our environment for future generations is now widely accepted across the political spectrum it was natural that the greens needed to find a unique selling point and they found it is being the party of high taxes and separation their car park tax will squeeze scotland hard working motorists who as yet can not afford to switch to why should individuals be forced to pay for the carbon producing technology that they must use time and again the conservatives have shown the way whether it be the agriculture bill the cleaner fuels scotland bill or our commitment to carbon neutrality by we are the party that strikes the correct balance and is best able to provide scotland with the tools and innovation needed to detail with climate change
only as far as these things serve they company own profits preventing climate change does not do that it helps their competitors as much as themselves therefore investing into it is a pure loss for them it therefore necessary for the government to intervene and compel everyone to contribute their part these regulations finally force companies to pay up for the damages they have been causing
the usual reason their policies most closely align with my values they the only serious party that is coming remotely close to what has to happen in climate change and the biodiversity crisis they tend towards far fairer wealth redistribution do get me wrong i do think they perfect but under the current system they the best we got and under preferential voting the idea that it a wasted vote is incorrect my vote will end up with the alp candidate in the lower house
it not deep though it is a surface level observation gridlock on commutes lack of decent public transit infrastructure wealth gap climate change etc etc etc everywhere anyone looks there are signs the drug and alcohol dependencies suicides failed marriages low worker productivity obesity rates etc etc there really is no end

new conventional nuclear plants exorbitant costs and long lead times advanced nuclear is not yet proven commercially viable implying any of this attributes to renewables there still has been replaced a single conventional plant by renewables there are plenty of very different plans on how to achieve a grid based on renewables of which none is proven to be working and cheap is only true for lcoe which is a metric that does not work for a renewable grid that cost and time argument is just anti nuclear propaganda that ignores climate change as a real threat either way we are doing things that are expensive and will have massive changes to our systems but neither of them is more expensive or troublesome than climate change and by using more technologies at once you reduce chance of failure and speed up the process and nuclear does not affect renewables negatively at all
just look through your comment history real quick you have serious problems you do believe in climate change you believe that people have good reasons to not wear face masks you do believe in covid statistics you think mail in voting is fraudulent despite multiple explanations about how it not get mental help
